If you are on Linux, just unzip the file in its own directory and type
'make'. Errors, if any, and proof that I'm a sloppy programmer will pile
up in .warn files.

If you use a static version of Allegro, delete the '-lalleg_unsharable'
from LIBS=	libmad.a -lalleg -lalleg_unsharable -L$(XLIBDIR)
$(XLIBS) $(SLIBS). If you use the dynamic, as far as I can see, you can
delete everything after it.

If you're on Windos in DJGPP, rename makefile.dj2 to makefile and type
'make'. The errors will go into .wrn files.

If you're on Windows in Mingw32, rename makefile.mgw. You'll have to
read the screen for any error messages.

If you are confident you'll actually be using MAD, change the 'prefix='
line to your own preference, then type 'make install'.
