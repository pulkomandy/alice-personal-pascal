Changes since release 1.40 of Atari ST Alice Pascal.

-------------------------------------ToDo-------------------------------------

Done - Fix kbd device so that it returns alt-keycodes properly

Done - look at memory allocation - don't allocate more than (MemAvail - safeamount)

Much Better - Fix edit window sliders ! - Important !!!

ToDo - Add option in mono for half-height chars

Done - Fix debug mode problem

STLibProc/STLibFunc questions, working with OSS, etc.

New templates (uppercase only, etc)

Hiding mouse after cursor positioning ?

Long_Integer type ?

Allow readln( win, "Hi there...", a, b, c, d );   etc

When out of memory, see if help is loaded.  If it is, close the file and
try the malloc again.

When getting stuff from workspaces, and it is too complicated to undo,
and you run out of memory - crash at f740 or f470 (Tim can't remember)
(also in Basic)

-------------------------------------Done-------------------------------------


01/02/87	Changed _rchar() in stunix.c to return chars > 128 as
		escape (27) followed by the char - 128.
		ToDo: Change the update.doc to reflect that the kbd device
		now works as documented.

01/02/87	Changed mmalloc in mem.c to return 0L if (MemUsed + size) >
		(MemAvail - SAFETY) where SAFETY is currently 5000L.

01/02/87	Changed do_suspend to not call TopCurEdit() if in debug
		mode.

01/06/87	Added overflow checking to the 'square' function for
		integers in file function.c  (called IntCheck( res, 'square'));

01/06/87	Changed top_cup and bot_cdown to set a global flag 'MvSlider'
		to indicate whether or not we scrolled a full line or not.
		(see if the sub line differs by one).  Thus we will only
		update the slider position when we scroll a whole line.

01/08/87	Added calls to display(TRUE) in do_gbugon() and do_gbugoff()
		in stevent.c since the screen was not being updated properly
		(breakpoints (debug only) goop)

01/11/87	Rewrote Mark Williams lsbrk function (in lsbrk.c) to check
		the amount of system memory left, and if the lsbrk would
		not leave enough memory in the system heap, to fail.

01/12/87	Uploaded the new expparse.c from the AT, which has a fix
		for entering negative signs after commas in the one-line-
		editor

01/16/87	Changed the 'stdisk.prg' program to write an EXECUTABLE
		boot block, and added in code to verify copies.

01/16/87	Added a call to MenuCtrl( TRUE ) at the top of the mainloop
		to ensure that the mouse is always on when at command level.

01/16/87	Added a call to suspendGraphics in run_error.
		Mouse wasn't turned on properly when a run_error happened
		and you were in immediate mode, not suspended

01/16/87	Added a call to vswr_mode( REPLACE ) in resetVDI, file
		stgraph.c so that the draw mode will always be REPLACE
		when the editor is running.

01/16/87	Changed the smallest edit window size in stwindow.c

01/19/87	Added a close workstation call to GemTerm in stinit.c
		May have been cause of 'new version' bug.

01/19/87	Changed Display( TRUE ) || big_change to call count_lines
		in GEM, so that the slider will be updated.  Removed
		count_lines from page_up, etc in command.c

01/21/87	Changed the command that is executed when 'delete' is
		selected from the menu to 'delete it', instead of plain
		delete.

01/21/87	Changed the 'badcolour' help screen ref in stgraph.c to
		'badcolor'

03/09/87	Did backups.  Diffs logged in backup_14.

03/10/87	Fixed bug in stgraph.c.  Calling RemoveEditWindows twice
		while running program caused ALICE to hang.

03/10/87	Changed the version number in the resource file to 1.4.3
		ALICE_VERSION unchanged, as that would mean we have
		to duplicate the supplemental disk as well (because of
		the help file)

03/11/87	Changed Error message 18 from 'bad transmogify...' to
		'Type must be a named type or placeholder for abs'

03/11/87	Changed the 'what can I type menu' to have the help button
		disabled, since paction help is not available.

03/11/87	Added Mediach checking for the help file so that the
		user can pull out the help disk without disaster.
