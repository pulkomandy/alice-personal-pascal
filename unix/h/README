This is the ALICE header files.  Also included here is the complex m4
script that built ALICE's table of syntax tree nodes.   The node.m4
file contains everything about every syntax node.  It builds a set of
.h files for the node names, and builds some .c files with the data in them.

Today this might be done a bit different but for now it works.  If you want
to add a new node to the syntax trees, it should be possible with a full
recompile.   However, if you don't do it right you might renumber the
nodes and ruin the loading of old files.    

There used to be some gaps to add new nodes, they are now all gone, I think.
You can add non-standard nodes at the end.
