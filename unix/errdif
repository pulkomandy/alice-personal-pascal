> "baddot`dot (.) requires a record variable on the left"
	if you don't have a record on the left of a dot, it won't let you
	type in anything on the right.  apologize, and tell them to put in
	a proper variable of record type.
	(I think this used to be called "needrec")
> "bnum`Badly formed number %s on input"
> "bnum`Sorry, '%s' isn't a valid number, please try again"
	these happen when doing a readln and the user types a garbage
	number.  The first is from a file, the second is for interactive
	readln
> "complex`Nasty Error - expression or program too complex"
	yup, this means alice ran out of stack space on something.
	Pretty unlikely, but tell them to reduce the depth of their tree.
	Probably they have a very complex expression.
> "foref`Symbol used before it is defined"
	This is illegal in pascal.  you can't say
	type blat = integer;
	     integer = real;

	     because although it's legal to redefine integer, you can't
	     do it if it has been used.
> "nodecl`There is no declaration for this item"
	the new decl command that goes to the declaration of an item gives
	this if it doesn't have one.  ie. it isn't a symbol or it is
	a builtin or undefine symbol.
> "notsusp`Your program is not currently in a suspended state"
	I think you have this one
> "nottype`%s is not a type name, you can't put it here"
	This happens on a type placeholder.  We reject all non-types

> "opt`Invalid m#= option"
	this is a syntax error on the macro assign command line option.
	this error can't be explained as it aborts the program.
> "redo`Nothing to redo"
	you have this, don't you?
> "scrxy`ScrXY: Illegal screen query %d\n"

> "toolong`Line on screen too long"
	nasty nasty.  Lines limited to 250 chars.  Have then shrink it
	immediately.
> "undefcase`Undefined case %s"
> "undeft`Undefined type name"

	I think you have these.

	name change, you should have this
> "varcon`Constant is not of the right type"
	inside a variant record, the  constants must all match the tag
	type.
