* means low priority for now
Editor:
!!	Error messages for unimplemented features
	fix up debugging prints to use printt3, etc.
	load/save a subtree
	labels with leading zeros. (*)
	window for immediate mode - need this at least
	debug on typecheck - pvs
	Editing of with, fix errors that are signaled (*)
	entry of records (ability to do field without record?) (*)
	windows (*)
	cursor move after null type can still go quite a distance (*)
	fancier macros (2 or more char) (*)
	lines longer than 255 chars - treeprint buffer is fixed size (*)
	multi-d arrays - special representation *
	search user interface (*)
	special local variable for function assign instead of actual symbol
	reading in templates from a file (*)
Interp:
	Subrange and other checks on value parameters
	some non checked errors on goto
	check for duplication of label - this is hard...
	typecheck fixing with errors
	proper creation of frames in immediate execution (how do I duplicate
	  this bug)
	function & procedure params - checks, 
	printpoints - variable assign, routine call (*)
	Assigning to for loop variable caught (*)
	variant records checking(*)
	writeln of records, small arrays * - for debug mostly
	new & dispose with variants. - check them at least (*)
	new & dispose with table of pointers & double indirection
	traceback statements (*)
	start up again after error? (*)
	start up again from different point (manual goto) (*)
	duplicate cases detection (*)
Parser bugs:
	withs,
