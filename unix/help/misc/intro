                             Welcome to ALICE!

     We hope you'll find that ALICE helps you write programs, run programs,
and find mistakes in programs more easily than anything else you might have
tried.  ALICE can do an enormous number of things...which means that you
won't be able to learn everything in one sitting.  However, you can
certainly learn the basics very quickly.
     One of the most important things to learn is how to select things from
a menu.  A menu is just a list of things that you can do or look at.  ALICE
uses menus for many things -- in fact, you've already seen ALICE's Starting
Menu when you first started ALICE up.
     To choose a selection from a menu, roll the trackball until the selec-
tion you want lights up.  When the selection is lit, press the spacebar.
You can also just press the letter that labels the menu selection.
     Here's a chance to try this.  We're going to give you a menu.  Choose
the second item on the menu if you want more on ALICE.
