     All the commands of ALICE may be found on menus.  To execute any
command, you just have to select it from the appropriate menu.  You can
also press a key that has been bound to the command, or press CTRL-X and
type in the command name and any arguments it takes.
     The Master Menu contains a list of all the other command menus.  To
get this menu, press F11 (the unlabelled key to the right of F10).  From
