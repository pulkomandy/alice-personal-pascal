     The ASCII character set is how your computer represents characters.
Each character is represented by eight memory bits.
     One important characteristic of the ASCII character set is that all
the upper case letters are given in order, as are all the lower case
letters.  This means that 'b' is one more than 'a', 'c' is one more than
'b', and so on.  This is not true in some other character sets.
