     Then we'll go on.  First, we'll cover some basics of writing programs
with ALICE.
     When you start creating a program with ALICE, it lays out a skeleton
to get you started.  This skeleton is called a "template" and it shows you
the general lay-out of a normal Pascal program.
     Some parts of this skeleton are "placeholders".  These are like blanks
that you'll be asked to fill in.  For example, there is a placeholder to
show where you should fill in the name of the program, a placeholder where
you fill in the instructions, and so on.  Placeholders are always
underlined on the screen so that they're easy to spot.
