     While you are single-stepping through your program, you may want to
obtain information about things in your program.  For example, after an
assignment operation, you may want to check the value of the variable that
was assigned a new value.  This lets you make sure that the assigned value
was what you expected it to be.
     To do this, press F7 to obtain the Miscellaneous Menu and choose the
"Immediate mode block" selection from the menu.  This opens up an
"immediate block" in your program.  Instructions typed into the immediate
block will be carried out as soon as you press ENTER.
     As a short form, you can just enter "?" to stand for "writeln".  For
example, "?a" is the same as "writeln(a)".
