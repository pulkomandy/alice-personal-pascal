     The "?" is called the wild card search character because it can stand
for any character when using the SEARCH, RSEARCH, or AGAIN commands.
     In all searching commands, ALICE asks you to enter the string you want
to find.  When you enter this string, you can use "?" to stand for any
character.  Thus if you ask ALICE to search for "i?t", the string could be
found in words like "integer", "list", "dictionary", and so on.
