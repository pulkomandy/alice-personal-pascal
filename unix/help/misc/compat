     Pascal has rigid rules describing what types of values may be assigned
to what types of variables.  If a particular value can be assigned to a
variable, the type of the value and variable are said to be "compatible".
     Subranges of the same base type are compatible.  Sets of the same base
type are compatible.  Integers may be assigned to real variables, but not
the other way around.  Similarly, the assignment is valid if the type of
the value is a subrange of the integers and the variable is real.
     The null set [] may be assigned to any set.  The special pointer "nil"
and things of the named "Pointer" type may be assigned to any pointer type.
