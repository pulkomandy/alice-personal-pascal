Changing an expression:
     Highlight the expression or part of the expression you want to edit,
then issue the EDIT command by pressing CTRL-E or by choosing "Edit" from
the Changes Menu.  This calls on the Simple Text Editor to edit the expres-
sion.  Since EDIT calls the Simple Text Editor, you can only use it on
expressions, string constants, and comments.
     To add something to the expression, move the cursor to the appropriate
position, then simply type in the new material.  To delete something, move
the cursor to the end of the material you want to delete and backspace.
You may also use the trackball to move the cursor back and forth in what
you are typing, if you find you want to go back and make corrections.
     When you have typed things in correctly, you have to show you are
finished by moving off the expression with >>, <<, TAB, SHIFT-TAB, or
ENTER.
