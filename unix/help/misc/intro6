     The UNDO command CTRL-U is very important.  It will undo anything you
just did.  If you press CTRL-U more than once, you undo more than one
thing.  For example, press CTRL-U three times and you undo the last three
things you did.
     As you fill in the blanks of the original program skeleton, you will
find that ALICE keeps on laying out more skeletons for you.  For example,
suppose you want to fill in a Statement placeholder with a WHILE statement.
As soon as you type "while" followed by a space, you will see that ALICE
lays out the template of a WHILE statement.  This template contains
placeholders for the various things that always have to be specified in a
WHILE statement.
     In this way, you put your program together with templates.  At every
point of editing, you'll find that you have a valid-looking program.  You
never have to worry about so-called "syntax" errors, errors that arise
because the form of your program is bad.  With ALICE, your program's form
is always perfect.
