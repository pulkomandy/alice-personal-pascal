     The easiest way to move the cursor is to use the trackball.  You can
also use

          >>                 -- to go to next empty placeholder
          <<                 -- to go to previous empty placeholder
          TAB                -- to go forward
          SHIFT-TAB          -- to go backward
          SHIFT-4            -- menu of commands that move cursor
