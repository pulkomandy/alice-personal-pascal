     Various features (such as breakpoints and single-stepping) "suspend"
programs in the middle of execution.  In other words, ALICE runs the
program partway through and then stops.  The status line at the bottom of
the screen tells you when you have a program suspended.
     With the program stopped, you can perform a number of debugging opera-
tions.  For example, you can ask for a TRACEBACK (see below for more
information).  You can also go into immediate mode and print out the values
of variables.
     ALICE can often continue executing a suspended program from where it
left off.  However, you cannot recontinue a program that stopped because
of an error or a program that you have edited since it was suspended.
     If you do not want to continue a suspended program, you must "sweep it
away" with the POP command (found on the Run-Time Menu).  The status line
will always tell you if you have any suspended programs still around.
