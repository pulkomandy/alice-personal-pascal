ALICE Memory Allocation (Technical Discussion)
      Regular Alice has two regions in which it allocates memory.  Each
    can grow to up to 64K in size and each can run out of memory
    independently of the other.
      The first region is the main data segment, used for general data,
    the runtime stack, your constant strings and identifier names.  Also
    placed here are bitmap fonts and windows.
    This is the first percentage shown on the status line.  This region
    is always 64K no matter how much of it is currently in use.  This is
    the region that Pascal pointers point into.
      The other region of memory is used for program elements and comments.
    The second percentage tells what is left here.  This region is allocated
    to an amount appropriate for the memory left in your computer.  When you
    issue the QNX "task +m" command, you should have at least 200K of free
    memory left to run ALICE, if the gtask isn't running.

      When ALICE starts up, it gives the sizes in kilobytes (K) instead of
    percentages, because both percentages are 100%.
