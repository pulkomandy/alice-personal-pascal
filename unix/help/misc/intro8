     The HELP key does more than obtain help about commands on menus.  If
you press HELP while you are editing your program, ALICE will offer you a
Help Menu.  This offers help in many areas: explaining an error message;
common operations in ALICE; information about Pascal; what commands are
available in ALICE; and an indication of what sort of thing you can type
at a particular point of the program.
     Since this HELP facility is able to do so much, we'll let you use it
to find out other things about ALICE.  When you have read all this on your
screen, press the spacebar.  That will erase this description.  Then press
HELP and choose the selection "Features of ALICE" to find out more about
ALICE.
