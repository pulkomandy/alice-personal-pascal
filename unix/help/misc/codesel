     Before some ALICE commands may be issued, you have to select a portion
of your code for the command to work on.  You do this by moving the cursor
on top of the code you want to select, then pushing F10.  This will
highlight whatever is directly under the cursor and anything this thing
contains.  For example, if you place the cursor on the "while" of a WHILE
loop, you will highlight the entire loop, including the statements inside
the loop.
     If you want to highlight more than one thing and its contents, move
the cursor again.  Whatever the cursor crosses will also be highlighted.
     If you change your mind about selecting something, just press F10
again and the highlighting will disappear.
     Code selection indicates to various commands what section of code you
want to work with.  If you only want to work with a single variable,
constant, or comment, you don't need to select it in the way we've just
described.  Simply move the cursor to the thing you want to work with and
issue the appropriate command.
