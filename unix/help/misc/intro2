     Good!  You picked the right menu selection.  You likely noticed that
the other selection on the menu was "Do nothing".  This appears as the
first thing on almost every menu in ALICE.  It means something like "I've
seen enough but don't want to do anything".  If you chose "Do nothing" on
the last menu, you'd go back to whatever you were doing before you asked
for this information about ALICE.
     Now, as we said before, ALICE helps you write programs, run programs,
and debug programs (debug means finding any mistakes you might have made).
For a full description of what ALICE can do, you should check the tutorial
guide, the reference manual, or the text book that describes ALICE.
However, if you want, we'll keep going with descriptions of the basics.
