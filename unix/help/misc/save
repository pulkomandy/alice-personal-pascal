Saving a Program:
     If you want to save the program in the current workspace, issue the
SAVE command by pressing CTRL-S (hold down the CTRL key, then press S).  If
you have never saved this program before, ALICE will ask you for the name
of the file where the program should be saved.  Type in this file name,
then press ENTER.
     If this isn't the first time you've saved this program, ALICE will
just save the program in the file it used before.  If you want to save the
program in a different file, you'll have to use the FILENAME command to set
the name of the file, BEFORE you do the save.
