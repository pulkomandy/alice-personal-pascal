Getting a List of What You Can Type Next:
     Pressing SHIFT-times (where you are using the "multiplication x" on
the keypad at the right of the ICON keyboard) will give you a list of
everything that you could type to fill in the current empty placeholder.
If you select something from this list, ALICE will put it into the
placeholder for you.  For example, if you are on a Variable placeholder,
issuing this command will give you the names of all the variables that
could legally be filled into the placeholder.  You can fill the placeholder
just by choosing the correct name from this menu.
