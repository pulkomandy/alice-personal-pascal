     File name menus are offered by several commands on the Files Menu,
e.g. LOAD and SAVE.  A file name menu lists the names of all the files
under your current directory.  Choosing a file from this list indicates
that you want to read that file.
     File name menus also offer a number of special entries.  There is
always an entry "Enter a file name" which allows you to enter a file name
that does not appear on the list.  You would choose this if you wanted to
save a program in a new file.
     Other special entries give the names of subdirectories of the current
directory.  These names are marked with a "+".  If you select such an entry,
you will be given a file name menu of all the files and directories under that
directory.  This subdirectory will become the current directory until you do
something to change directories again.
