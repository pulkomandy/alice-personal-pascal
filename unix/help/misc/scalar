     We use the term "scalar type" to refer to any of the following:

          integer
          char
          boolean
          enumerated type
          subranges of the above

Scalar types can be used for a variety of purposes.  For example, the
subscripts for an array must have the scalar type.
     Generally speaking, scalar types are types whose values you could
list, in order.  This is why "real" isn't a scalar type, since you'd have
difficulty listing all the possible real numbers.
