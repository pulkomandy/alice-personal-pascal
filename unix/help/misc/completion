     The Symbol Completion feature of ALICE can save you a great deal of
typing.  Whenever you are typing in the name of something (a variable, a
subprogram, a type, etc.), type the first few characters, then press C-cedille
ALICE will look through the list of all the names it knows and see which
names begin with the characters you've typed.  If there is only one such
name, it will finish off the name you're typing -- you don't have to type
anything else.  If there are several names that begin in the same way,
ALICE will give you a list of these names.  Choose the name you want from
the list and ALICE will finish typing the name for you.
