     The easiest way to quit ALICE is to press F8 and choose the selection
that says "Quit ALICE".  You can also quit by pressing the (beta) key.
     If you have been editing a program and have not saved it, ALICE will
not let you quit immediately.  Instead, it will display a menu that gives
you a chance to save your program before quitting, or to quit without
saving.
