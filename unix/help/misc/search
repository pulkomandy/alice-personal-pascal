Searching for a Particular Piece of Code:
     To search for a particular piece of code, press CTRL-F.  ALICE will
ask you to type in the string of characters you want to search for (e.g.
a variable name).  Enter this string, then press ENTER.  The search will
begin at the current position of the cursor and keep going to the end of
the program.  If the thing you're looking for hasn't been found by that
time, ALICE will "wrap around" to the beginning of your program and keep
looking.
     The next time you press CTRL-F, ALICE will show you what you were
searching for the last time.  If you want to search for the same thing,
just press ENTER; otherwise, enter the new string you want to search for,
and THEN press ENTER.
