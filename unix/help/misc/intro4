     Creating a program is just a matter of filling in the blanks.  To fill
in an empty placeholder, you just move the cursor to the placeholder and
type what should go in that spot.  (The cursor is the mark on the screen
that shows where you're typing.)
     Of course, this means you have to know how to move the cursor.  The
easiest method is to roll the trackball.  Moving the trackball in a
particular direction moves the cursor in the same direction.
     Another way to move the cursor is to press the TAB key.  This moves
the cursor forward a short distance.  If you press >>, the cursor will jump
to the next empty placeholder in your program.  You can then fill in the
placeholder with whatever is appropriate.
