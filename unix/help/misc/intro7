     As you work with ALICE, you will find that you want to issue editing
commands that perform various operations.  There are several ways to issue
these commands.  Sometimes, all you have to do is press a special key
combination, the way that CTRL-U performs the UNDO command.
     Other times, you will choose a command from a menu.  If you press F11,
the key beside F10, you will get a list of all the command menus of ALICE.
Choose any selection from this list, and you will get the corresponding
menu.  To find out what a command on the menu does, highlight the command,
then press HELP.
