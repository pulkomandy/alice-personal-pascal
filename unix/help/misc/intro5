     When you are filling in a placeholder, it's always possible that
you'll make a mistake.  No problem!  If you're still part way through
things, you can just press the backspace key to back up.  As you back up
over what you've typed, you'll see it disappear.  In this way, you can rub
out your mistake and type things over again.
     Of course, you may not notice your mistake until you've finished
filling in the placeholder.  In fact, YOU may not notice the mistake at all
-- it might be ALICE that tells you there's something wrong.  If ALICE
finds that you've made a mistake, it'll light up the mistake and give you
an error message describing what went wrong.
     This is the point at which you might want to press CTRL-U.  To do
this, you hold down the CTRL key, then press U.  This means UNDO, and it
"undoes" what you just did.  The mistake goes away, and you can fix things
up.
