     Pointers point to other kinds of data.  For example, you can have
pointers to integers, pointers to records, pointers to enumerated types,
and so on.  There is also a specific data type named "Pointer" (see below).
If P is the name of the pointer, P^ stands for the thing that the pointer
points to.
     Pointers are set up with the "new" procedure.  This creates a variable
that the pointer can point to and points the pointer toward that variable.
     The value of one pointer can be assigned to another in an assignment
statement, provided that the two point to the same type of value.

Pointers Examples:
     var
         pc1, pc2 : ^char;
     begin
     new(pc1);
     pc1^ := 'A';
     pc2 := pc1;
     writeln(pc2^,' is the letter A.');
