Single-stepping Through a Program:
     To single-step, just press F2 over and over.  Every time you press the
key, ALICE will execute another instruction.
     If you come to a subprogram call, ALICE will execute the subprogram
step by step as well.  If you want do not want to single-step through
subprogram calls, use SUPERSTEP.
     You will notice that single-stepping splits the screen into two parts,
one showing the source code and one showing your output.  To return the
screen to normal, press F6 to get the Run-Time Menu and choose the "Debug
off" selection.
