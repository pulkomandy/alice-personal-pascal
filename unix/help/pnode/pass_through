     A "pass through comment" is treated like a comment in that ALICE
ignores it when executing your program.  However, this kind of comment is
not enclosed by brace brackets when your program is displayed on the screen
or written into a text file.  The comment is simply printed out, as is.
     Pass through comments are usually created for programs that will be
run with another version of Pascal.  Things that are not supported by ALICE
Pascal can be entered as pass-through comments; in this way, ALICE will not
regard them as errors, even though ALICE doesn't understand them.
