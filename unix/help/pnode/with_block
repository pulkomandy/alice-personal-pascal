     The WITH statement lets you use a simple shorthand to refer to the
fields in a record.  On the WITH statement itself, you give the name of a
single record variable.  This must be filled in before you can use any
field names inside the WITH statement.  Inside the BEGIN/END block that
follows the WITH statement, you may refer to the fields of that record
simply by their names; you don't have to give the name of the record
variable itself.
     If you make editing changes that change the type of the variable at
the top of a WITH block, it is best to retype the insides of the WITH
block, since ALICE sometimes has difficulties with this situation.

with Examples:
     var
         book : record
             title : packed array [1..40] of char;
             fiction : Boolean; {Is it fiction?}
     begin
     with book do begin
         title := 'War and Peace';
         fiction := true;
         end;
     if book.fiction then begin ...
         {Need "book." outside the WITH}
