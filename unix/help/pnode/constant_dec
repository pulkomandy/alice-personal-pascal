     A constant declaration gives a name to a constant.  This sort of
declaration appear in the CONST declaration section of a program or
subprogram.  The name of a named constant may be used anywhere that the
value of the constant would be legal.
     Named constants are used to make your program easier to understand and
easier to change.
     Note: constants in constant expressions may only be single characters,
integers, strings, or reals.  They may not be expressions, nor can they be
function calls like "chr(13)".

Constant Declaration Examples:
     const
         PI = 3.14159;
         SIZE = 100;
         DOLLAR = '$';
     var
         list : array [1..SIZE] of real;
     begin
     list[1] := 2 * PI;
     writeln(DOLLAR,' is the dollar sign');
