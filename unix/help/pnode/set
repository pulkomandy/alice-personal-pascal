     A set constant is written as a number of set elements inside square
brackets.  The elements may be specified individually or as subranges.
     The elements must all have the same type.  They may be characters,
integers, or enumerated values.  The type of the set constant will be "set
of T", where T is the type of the elements.  For example, if all the ele-
ments are characters, the type of the set constant will be "set of char".
     If a set is empty, you may expand it by typing "[" on the empty set.

Set Constant Examples:
     [1,2,3,4]   {Set of integers}
     ['a'..'z']  {Set of characters}
     [mon..fri]  {Set of days}
