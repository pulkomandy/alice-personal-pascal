     A subtraction operation subtracts two numbers or expressions.  You can
only subtract numeric values (reals or integers).
     If one or both of the things being subtracted are "real", the result
of the subtraction will be "real".  If both are integers, the result of the
subtraction will be "integer".
     The subtraction operator "-" is also used to find the difference
between two sets.  In this case, A-B is the set of all elements in A that
are not in B.  The base types of the two sets must be compatible.

Valid Subtraction Examples:
     3-5     3.1-2.3     4.4-2     2-a     [1..100]-[5..20]
Invalid Subtraction Examples:
     'a'-2     (b>c)-4.3     [1,2,3]-['a'..'z']
