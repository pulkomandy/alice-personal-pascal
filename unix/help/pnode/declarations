     The declaration sections of your program tell ALICE what names you
will be using for various things in your program.  The declarations always
come before the instructions in programs and subprograms.
     LABEL declarations tell what integers you will be using for labels.
CONST declarations assign names to constants.  TYPE declarations assign
names to types.  VAR declarations tell ALICE the names of the variables you
intend to use and the type of data each will hold.  PROCEDURE and FUNCTION
declarations tell ALICE about the subprograms your program will use.  Each
procedure and function can have its own set of declarations in addition to
the declarations that apply to the whole program.
     You may type a declaration keyword like "var" anywhere in the program.
ALICE will move to the appropriate declaration section so you can add a new
declaration.

Declaration Examples:
     label 1,2,3 ;
     const pi = 3.14159 ;
     type day = [sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat];
     var i : integer;
     procedure go(i : integer; var a : char);
     function sin(x : real) : real ;
