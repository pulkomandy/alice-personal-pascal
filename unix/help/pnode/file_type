     The "file" type is used when you want to read or write to a file.  You
must declare a file variable with

          var
              Name : file of Type;

where Name is the name of the file variable and Type is the type of
information that is stored in the file.  You must also use "reset",
"rewrite", or "append", to initialize the file variable and set up the
associated file for reading or writing.  Once you have done this, you may
use the reading or writing subprograms on the file.

File Examples:
     var
         infile, outfile : file of integer;
         i : integer;
     begin
     reset(infile,'file1');
     rewrite(outfile,'file2');
     read(infile,i);
     write(outfile,i);
