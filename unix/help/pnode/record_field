     A field declaration is part of the declaration of a record.  Each
field in a record has its own name and its own type.  The different fields
in a record allow the record to hold many kinds of data.
     When you want to use a field inside a record, you give the name of the
record, then a dot (.), then the name of the field.

Field Declaration Examples:
     type
         person = record {Information about a person}
             name : packed array [1..40] of char;
             age : integer;
             height : record
                 feet,inches : integer;
                 end;
             end;
     var
         Fred, Nancy, George : person;
     begin
     Fred.name := 'Fred';
     Fred.age := 16;
     Fred.height.feet := 5;
     Fred.height.inches := 10;
