     The "in" operator tells you whether a value is in a set.  The value
must be the same type as the elements in the set.
     The result of E in S is a Boolean (true/false) value.  It will be
"true" if the element E is really in the set S, and "false" otherwise.

In Examples:
     if c in ['a'..'z'] then begin...
     while 0 in S do begin...
     if not (day in [mon,tue,wed,thu,fri]) then begin...
