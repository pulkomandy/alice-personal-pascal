     A string constant is written as any number of characters enclosed in
single or double quote marks.  You can use any character in the ASCII
character set (anything you can type in from the terminal keyboard, and a
lot of others too).
     If you want the string to contain the same sort of quote mark that you
are using to enclose the string, you have to type TWO of those quotes.  If
you only type one, ALICE thinks it's the end of the string.
     Strings in double quotes always have the type "packed array of char".
Single quotes give "packed array of char" except when they enclose a single
character; in this case, the type is just "char".
     A string constant with no characters in it is called the "null
string".  You can only create one of these with double quotes: "".

String Constant Examples:
     'A string'
     'Don''t forget to put two single quotes'
     "Don't need two singles if doubles outside"
     ""  {Null string}
