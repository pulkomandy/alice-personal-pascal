     The REPEAT loop REPEATs a number of instructions until a given condi-
tion becomes true.  The instructions will always be executed once, even if
the condition starts out as true.

repeat Examples:
     i := 0;
     repeat
         writeln(i,i*i,i*i*i);
         i := i + 1;
         until i > 10;
