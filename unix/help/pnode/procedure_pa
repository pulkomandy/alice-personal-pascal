     A procedure parameter appears in the heading of a subprogram declara-
tion and stands for a procedure that is passed as an argument to the
subprogram.  When you pass a procedure to a subprogram, the declaration of
the procedure parameter in the subprogram's heading must be exactly the
same as the declaration of the procedure argument in the caller.
     A lot of built-in procedures may NOT be passed as procedure arguments.
For example, "readln" and "writeln" may not be passed as procedure argu-
ments because they are defined in non-standard ways.

Procedure Parameter Examples:
     type
         info = array [1..N] of record ... end;
     function f( procedure proc(i,j:integer) ):real;
         ...
     procedure search( procedure sort(table:info) );
         ...
