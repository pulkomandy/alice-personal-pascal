     A DOWNTO FOR loop executes a group of statements one or more times.
It begins by assigning the value Start to the given Variable.  It then
executes the Statement in the block.  Once it has done this, it goes back
to the top, subtracts one from the value of Variable, then executes the
Statement again.  This process repeats itself over and over until the
variable finally gets down to the End value.  The Statement is repeated one
last time, and then execution continues to the statement that follows the
"end;".

DOWNTO FOR Loop Examples:
     { Print first ten squares in reverse order }
     for i := 10 downto 1 do begin
         writeln(i*i);
         end;
