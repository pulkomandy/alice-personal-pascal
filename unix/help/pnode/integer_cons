     An integer constant is just a number without a decimal point or expo-
nent.  You can put a "+" or "-" sign in front of it if you want, but no
space between the sign and the rest of the number.  You cannot put blanks
or commas or anything else in the middle of the number -- just digits.
     The computer cannot accept integers that are too large or small.  The
largest possible integer is +32767 and the smallest is -32768.
