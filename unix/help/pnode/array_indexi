     The process of array indexing or subscripting is used to reference an
element in an array.  Arrays uses indices or subscripts to number or label
their elements.  The subscripts may have any scalar type; the type of the
subscripts is given at the same time that the array type is declared.
     To use a subscript, just enclose it in square brackets immediately
after the name of the array.

Array Indexing Examples:
     var
         iarr : array [1..10] of integer;
         table : array [char] of char;
     begin
     iarr[3] := 0;
     table['a'] := 'B';
