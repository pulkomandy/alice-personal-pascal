     A compound statement in Pascal begins with the keyword BEGIN and ends
with END.  This is also called a block.
     Sometimes the word "block" is used more loosely to mean any chunk of
source code.

Block Examples:
     begin
         writeln('This is an example');
         writeln('of two lines in a block.');
         end;
     if a > b then begin
         writeln('This block is in');
         writeln('an IF statement.');
         end;
