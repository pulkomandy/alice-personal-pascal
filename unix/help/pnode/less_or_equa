     The <= operator decides if one thing is less than or equal to another.
The things being compared must have the same type.
     The result of A<=B is a Boolean (true/false) value.  It will be "true"
if A really is less than or equal to B, and "false" otherwise.  If you are
comparing two enumerated types, A is less than B if it comes earlier in the
list that names all the values of the type.

Less Than Or Equal Examples:
     if a <= b then begin...
     while func(x) <= 0.0 do begin...
     if (c >= 'a') or (c <= 'z') then begin...
