     The symbol "nil" is a predefined name that stands for the null
pointer.  This is a pointer that doesn't point to anything.  The value
"nil" may be assigned or compared to a pointer of any type.  If you attempt
to use a null pointer, you will get an error.

Valid Nil Examples:
     var
         pc : ^char;
     begin
     pc := nil;
        ...
     if pc = nil then begin ...
Invalid Nil Examples:
     pc := nil;
     pc^ := 'A';
       {"pc" doesn't point to anything}
