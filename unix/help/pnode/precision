     When you are writing a real value with "write" or "writeln", you may
specify a precision.  This tells how many digits you want the computer to
write out after the decimal point of the real value.
     If you want to specify a precision, you also have to specify a field
width.  The field width specifier follows the value you want to write out,
and the precision follows the field width specifier.  Both the field width
specifier and the precision are written as a colon (:) followed by a posi-
tive integer.
     If you want N places after the decimal point, your precision should be
:N.  For example, :2 gives you two places after the decimal point (the
usual way that money values are written out).
     If you have something like "a:8" in a writing instruction and you want
to add a precision on the end, you must edit the entire "a:8", not just the
"8".
               Precision Examples:
     var
         price : real;  {Price of something}
     begin
     price := 10.00;
     writeln('The price is $',price:6:2);
          {Will print out $ 10.00}
     writeln('The price is $',price:6:3);
          {Will print out 0.000}
