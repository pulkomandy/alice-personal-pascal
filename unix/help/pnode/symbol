     A Symbol is the name of something: a variable, a subprogram, or a
named type or constant.  Symbol names can be made up of letters, digits,
and underscore (_) characters.  The first character of a symbol name cannot
be a digit.  Symbols names can be any length from 1 to 255 characters.
     The first time you enter a particular symbol name, ALICE will note
which letters are in upper case and which are in lower.  From that point
onward, ALICE will always display the symbol name in that way, even if you
type it differently.  For example, if you start off calling a variable
"Xyz", ALICE will always display it that way, even if you type "XYZ",
"xyz", etc.

Valid Symbol Examples:
     Hello   lucky_day   C1   ab_123
Invalid Symbol Examples:
     2c   x!yz   what?
