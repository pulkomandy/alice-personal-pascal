     A FOR loop executes a group of statements one or more times.  It
begins by assigning the value Start to the given Variable.  It then
executes the Statement in the block.  Once it has done this, it goes back
to the top, adds one to the value of Variable, then executes the Statement
again.  This process repeats itself over and over until the variable
finally reaches the End value.  The Statement is repeated one last time,
and then execution continues to the statement that follows the "end;".
     The Variable and the Start and Finish values must all have the same
scalar type.

FOR Loop Examples:
     { Print first ten squares }
     for i := 10 to 1 do begin
         writeln(i*i);
         end;
