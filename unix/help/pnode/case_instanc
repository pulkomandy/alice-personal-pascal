     A Case-Instance is part of a CASE statement.  It consists of one or
more constants (called the case labels) and a number of instructions.  If
the Value of the variable at the start of the CASE statement matches one
of the constants that label the instructions, the instructions will be
executed.  The constants must be of a scalar type, and have the same type
as the CASE Value.

Case Instances Examples:
     case i of
         1: answer := x;
         2: answer := x*x;
         3: answer := x*x*x;
     end;
