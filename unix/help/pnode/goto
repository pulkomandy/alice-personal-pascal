     GOTO tells ALICE to go to the statement with the specified label and
continue execution there.  The label must be an integer that has been
declared in a LABEL declaration section of your program.
     As a general rule, you should try to avoid the use of GOTOs in your
programs -- they tend to make the logic of your program harder to follow.
Whenever you are tempted to use a GOTO, first ask yourself if there is a
more elegant way to express what you want to do, using such statements as
FOR or WHILE.
     You will receive an error message if a GOTO attempts to jump out of a
subprogram while you are using SUPERSTEP to execute your program.

GOTO Examples:
     goto 5;
     if eof() then begin
         writeln('Something wrong happened!');
         goto 999;
     end;
