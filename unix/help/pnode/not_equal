     The <> operator decides if two things are not equal.  The things being
compared must have the same type.
     The result of <> is a Boolean (true/false) value.  It will be "true"
if the things being compared are not equal, and "false" if they are equal.

Inequality Examples:
     if a <> b then begin ...
     while (I div J) <> 0 do begin ...
     if (c <> '+') and (c <> '-') then begin ...
