     A real constant has a decimal point, an exponent, or both.  Constants
may have leading "+" or "-" signs.
     If it has a decimal point, there has to be at least one digit before
the decimal and one digit after.
     If it has an exponent, the exponent is written as an "e" or "E"
followed by a positive or negative integer.  The exponent stands for 10 to
the power of the integer; therefore E2 stands for 10 to the power 2, or
100.
