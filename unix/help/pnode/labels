     A label declaration lists the labels that are used in a program or
subprogram.  Labels may be integers with no more than four digits.  The
labels in the list are separated by commas.
     Labels must be declared in the LABEL declaration section before they
can be used by GOTO instructions.  Since GOTOs are a mark of bad
programming, you should never need to have a LABEL declaration section.

Label Declaration Examples:
     label
         100,200,300,400;
     begin
     400: writeln('This has a label.');
      ...
     goto 400;
