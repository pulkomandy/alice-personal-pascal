     The = operator decides if two things are equal.  The things being
compared must have the same type, with the exception of strings.  The
strict rules of Pascal say that strings of different lengths have different
types, but "=" can be used to compare strings of different lengths.
     The result of = is a Boolean (true/false) value.  It will be "true" if
the things being compared really are equal, and "false" otherwise.

Equality Examples:
     if a = b then begin ...
     while (I div J) = 0 do begin ...
     if (c = ' ') or (c = '_') then begin ...
     if str1 = "hello" then begin ...
