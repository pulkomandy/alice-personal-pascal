     Parentheses may be used to enclose values inside expressions.  When
the computer evaluates an expression that contains things in parentheses,
it will always evaluate what is inside the parentheses first.  This lets
you change Pascal's usual order for calculating things (e.g. multiplication
before addition).

Parentheses Examples:
     3 + 4 * 5
        {Will be 23, because multiplication first}
     (3 + 4) * 5
        {Will be 35, because addition first}
