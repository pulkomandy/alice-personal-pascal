     Anything that is written with "write" or "writeln" can have a field
width added on the end.  This is a colon (:) and a positive integer that
comes right after what you want to write out.  The integer tells the
minimum number of characters that the writing procedure should use when
writing out a value.  If the value doesn't need that many characters, the
writing procedure will add blanks to "pad the value out" to the minimum
width.
     If you have something like "a:8" in a writing instruction and you want
to add a precision on the end, you must edit the entire "a:8", not just the
"8".
     In the examples below, we use the letter 'b' to show where ALICE puts
in blanks.

Field Width Examples:
     a := 1;
     b := 2.0;
     writeln(a,b);
        output is
     1 2.0
     writeln(a:8,b:5);
        output is
     bbbbbbb1bb2.0
