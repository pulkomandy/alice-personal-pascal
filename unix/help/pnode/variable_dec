     A Variable Declaration appears in the VAR section of a program or
subprogram.  The declaration gives the name of one or more variables and
tells what type of data the variable(s) will hold.  ALICE also requires
that you provide a comment, describing what the variable(s) will be used
for.

VAR Declaration Examples:
     var
         i,j : integer ; { Index variables }
         str : packed array[1..100] of char ; { Character string }
         ptr : ^real; { Pointer to real value }
