     A multiplication operation multiplies two numbers or expressions.  You
can only multiply numeric values (reals or integers).
     If one or both of the things being multiplied are "real", the result
of the multiplication will be "real".  If both are integers, the result of
the multiplication will be "integer".
     The multiplication operator "*" is also used to indicate set intersec-
tion.  The base types of the two sets must be compatible.

Valid Multiplication Examples:
     2*3     4.8*1.2     3*4.2     a*b     [1..10]*[5..20]
Invalid Multiplication Examples:
     'a'*3    true*3.1     4*(c>d)     [1..10]*['a'..'z']
