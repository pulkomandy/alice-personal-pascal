     A character constant is written as a single character inside single
quote marks, as in 'a'.  This sort of constant has the type char.
     If you want a character constant that holds a single quote, you must
type TWO single quotes inside the other quotes, for a total of four quotes.
     To get a string constant that contains a single letter, use double
quotes, as in "a".  Double quotes always give a string constant, never a
character constant.

Character Constant Examples:
     c := 'A';
     quote := '''';
     writeln('The single quote character is ',quote);
