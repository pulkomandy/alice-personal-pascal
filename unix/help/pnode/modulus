     The "mod" operator is the partner of "div".

          A mod B

is the remainder you get when you divide A by B.  Both arguments must be
integer values or expressions, and the result is an integer.
     If an expression contains many different sorts of operations, "mod"
operations will be carried out before additions and subtractions.  "/",
"*", "div", and "mod" operations are carried out in the order they appear
in the expression.

mod Examples:
     if (A mod 3) = 0 then begin
         writeln('A is a multiple of 3.');
         end;
     (A div B) * B + (A mod B)
        { Always equal to A }
