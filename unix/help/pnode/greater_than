     The > operator decides if one thing is greater than another.  The
things being compared must have the same type.
     The result of A>B is a Boolean (true/false) value.  It will be "true"
if A really is greater than B, and "false" otherwise.  If you are comparing
two enumerated types, A is greater than B if it comes later in the list
that names all the values of the type.

Greater Than Examples:
     if a > b then begin ...
     while (I div J) > 0 do begin ...
     if (c < 'a') or (c > 'z') then begin ...
