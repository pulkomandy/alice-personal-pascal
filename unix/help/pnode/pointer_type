     The pointer type is a special data type that points to another kind of
data.  For example, you can have pointers to integers, pointers to records,
pointers to enumerated types, and so on.  If P is the name of the pointer,
P^ stands for the thing that the pointer points to.
     Pointers are set up with the "new" procedure.  This creates a variable
that the pointer can point to and points the pointer toward that variable.
     The value of one pointer can be assigned to another in an assignment
statement, provided that the two point to the same type of value.  The
value "nil" stands for a null pointer: a pointer that doesn't point to
anything.

Pointer Examples:
     var
         pc1, pc2 : ^char;
     begin
     new(pc1);
     pc1^ := 'A';
     pc2 := pc1;
     writeln(pc2^,' is the letter A.');
     pc1 := nil;
