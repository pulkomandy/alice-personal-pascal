     The record data type can be made up of many different "fields" of
information.  Each field has its own name and type.  Field names can be the
same as names outside the record, but you can't have two fields of the same
name in the same record.
     Records may have a fixed part and a variant part.  The fixed part
appears in all records of a particular part.  The variant part may contain
different information in different records.

Record Examples:
     type
         book = record {Description of book}
             title : packed array [1..40] of char;
             case English : Boolean of
             true : ( Canadian : Boolean );
             false : ( language : packed array [1..20] of char);
             end;
     begin
     book.title := 'The Three Musketeers';
     book.English := false;
     book.language := 'French';
