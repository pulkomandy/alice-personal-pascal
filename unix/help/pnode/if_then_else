     The statements in the first BEGIN/END block are executed if a
particular condition is true; otherwise, the statements in the BEGIN/END
block that follows the "else" are executed.
     The Condition that follows the word "if" tells what the condition is.
It is almost always a relational condition.  If fact, the Condition can be
any that yields a Boolean (true/false) result.
     When you have an IF/ELSE statement, the statements following the "if"
are executed if the condition is true and the statements following the
"else" are executed otherwise.  There is also a form of IF that doesn't
have an ELSE part (see menu for further help).

IF-THEN-ELSE Examples:
     if c >= d then begin
         pos := c - d;
         end;
     else begin
         pos := d - c;
         end;
