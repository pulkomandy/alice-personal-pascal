     A packed array is an array that has been specially organized to take
up as little memory space as possible.  The most important type of packed
array is "packed array of char".  This type of array is also known as a
string.  String constants such 'abc' have the type "packed array of char".
     ALICE Pascal has a large number of features that help you work with
strings.  For further information, see the User's Guide.
     In ALICE Pascal, "packed" is actually ignored, since all character
arrays are automatically packed one character to a byte.

Packed Array Examples:
     var
         str : packed array [1..100] of char;
     begin
     str := 'String assignment';
     if str = 'String Comparison' then begin...
     i := StrLen(str);
        {Built-in function}
