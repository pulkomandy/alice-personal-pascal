           ... {Comment} ...

stands for a section of code that the programmer has decided to HIDE.  The
Comment should tell what the hidden code does.  The HIDE command just tells
ALICE that the hidden code should not be shown on the terminal screen when
the rest of the program is displayed.  The code is still there and will
work when you run the program.  Hiding uninteresting parts of your program
makes the rest of your program easier to read and understand.
     The REVEAL command will bring a section of code out of hiding.  REVEAL
may be found on the Change Menu.

Hidden Code Examples:
      ... {Perform initializations} ...
      ... {Write everything out}
