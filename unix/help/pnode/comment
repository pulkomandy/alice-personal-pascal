     Comments provide English descriptions of what the program is doing.
Even though comments do not affect how the program runs, they are an
important part of it.  Comments make it easier for someone reading your
program to understand it.
     ALICE Pascal requires comments at the beginning of every program (to
explain what the program does), at the beginning of every procedure and
function (to explain what they do), and at the end of every declaration (to
describe what the thing being defined will be used for).  ALICE also lets
you put a comment anywhere that you would normally put a statement or
declaration.  Simply type an opening brace bracket and ALICE will put out
the standard comment template.
     A special kludge for estheticians is provided.  If you make a comment
that consists of a single space, the braces will not be displayed, removing
the comment entirely from sight.  This is also how you get a blank line.

Comment Examples:
     { This program sorts data. }
     var
         str : packed array[1..100] of char; { Character string }
