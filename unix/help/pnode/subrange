     A subrange stands for a sequence of values that all have a certain
type.  For example, you can have a subrange of integers or a subrange of
characters.  To specify a subrange, give the lowest value in the sequence
and the highest, separated by "..".
     Your program can have subranges of any scalar type: integers,
characters, or user-defined scalar types.  A subrange is a type itself and
can be filled in for Type placeholders.

Valid Subrange Examples:
     1..10    'c'..'f'    mon..fri
     var
         matrix : array[1..10] of real;
         i : 1..100;
Invalid Subrange Examples:
     100..1    'c'..1    2.3..3.4
