     The expression "recname.fieldname" is used to refer to a field named
"fieldname" in a record variable named "recname".  The record variable must
be defined and valid before you can type in the field name; if not, ALICE
will not recognize the name of the field.
     If you change the record name, you should change the field name as
well, even if the field name is the same in both records.  This is due to
a technical detail in ALICE.
                Field Use Examples:
 type
     person = record {Information about a person}
         name : packed array [1..40] of char;
         age : integer;
         height : record
             feet,inches : integer;
             end;
         end;
 var
     Fred, Nancy, George : person;
 begin
 Fred.name := 'Fred';
 Fred.age := 16;
 Fred.height.feet := 5;
 Fred.height.inches := 10;
