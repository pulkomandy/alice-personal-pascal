     The indirection operation lets you use something that a pointer points
to.  If P is a pointer, then P^ is the thing that the pointer points to.
     The "new" procedure is used to create data objects that pointers may
point to.  Once this has been done, the data objects may be used indirectly
through the pointers.  For example,

          P^ := 1;

assigns the value 1 to whatever P points to.  In this case, P would have
to be a pointer to an integer.
     Indirection can also be used with file variables to obtain information
from the file "buffer".  For example, "output^" refers to the character
most recently written out.

Indirection Examples:
     var
         pc1, pc2 := ^char;
         ...
     new(pc1);
     pc1^ := 'A';
     pc2 := pc1;
     writeln(pc2^,' is the letter A.');
