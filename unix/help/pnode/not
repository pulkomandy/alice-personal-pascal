     The "not" operator reverses the truth of a Boolean (true/false) value
or expression.  "not(A)" is true if A is false, and false if A is true.
"A" must have the Boolean type, and the result of "not" is also Boolean.

not Examples:
     while not eoln do begin ...
     if not ( (c = '+') or (c = '-') ) then begin ...
