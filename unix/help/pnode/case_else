     An ELSE case may be part of a CASE statement.  It is like a case
instance but it has the special label "else".  ALICE will execute the
statements that follow the "else" label if the case value doesn't match any
of the other case instances.

Else Case Examples:
     case t mod 3 of
         0: begin
            writeln('Divisible by three');
            end;
         else begin
             writeln('Not divisible by three');
         end;
     end;
