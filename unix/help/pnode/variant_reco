     The variant part of a record can contain different fields of informa-
tion depending on the value of a "tag field".  The tag field need not have
a name.  In a record that holds information about books we might have

          case English : Boolean of
          true : (Canadian : Boolean);
          false : (language : packed array [1..20] of char;
                   translator : packed array [1..40] of char);

The "tag field" is a Boolean field named "English".  This field indicates
if the book was originally written in English.  The format of the remainder
of the record depends on whether the tag field is "true" or "false".

Variant Examples:
  {In a record describing cattle}
  case cowtype : (cow,bull,calf) of
  cow : (quarts : integer;);
  bull : (angry : Boolean;);
  calf : (fate : (veal,milkstock,breeding););
