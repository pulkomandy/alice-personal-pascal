     The >= operator decides if one thing is greater than or equal to
another.  The things being compared must have the same type.
     The result of A>=B is a Boolean (true/false) value.  It will be "true"
if A really is greater than or equal to B, and "false" otherwise.  If you
are comparing two enumerated types, A is greater than B if it comes later
in the list that names all the values of the type.

Greater Than Or Equal Examples:
     if a >= b then begin ...
     while (I div J) >= 0 do begin ...
     if (c >= 'a') or (c <= 'z') then begin ...
