     Type declarations appear in the TYPE section of a program or
subprogram.  A declaration gives a name and a data type that will be
associated with that name, as in

          type
              money = real; {Used for money sums}

Once you have done this, the name becomes a new type that can be entered
in any Type placeholder.  You can perform the same sort of operations on
this new named type that you could perform on the type that you assigned
to the name.  For example, you could perform the same operations on "money"
that you could on "real" variables.

Type Declaration Examples:
     type
         string = packed array [1..100] of char;
         days = (sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat);
         person = record
             name : string;
             age : integer;
             end;
