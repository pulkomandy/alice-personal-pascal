     ALICE allows you to comment out sections of code, allowing you to omit
lines of statements from the execution of your program.  Errors within the
commented out code are still reported.  To restore the section of code to
normal, select it and execute the 'raise' command.

For example:

	{
		writeln("This statement will not be executed");
	}
