     A statement label is used to label an instruction so that you can go
to that instruction with the GOTO instruction.
     As a general rule, you should try to avoid the use of GOTOs in your
programs -- they tend to make the logic of your program harder to follow.
Whenever you are tempted to use a GOTO, first ask yourself if there is a
more elegant way to express what you want to do, using such statements as
FOR or WHILE.

Labelled Statement Examples:
     goto 5;
        ...
     5: writeln('This is where the GOTO goes.');
