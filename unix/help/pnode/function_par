     A function parameter appears in the heading of a subprogram declara-
tion and stands for a function that is passed as an argument to the
subprogram.  For example, you may have a subprogram that is designed to
find the points where real-valued functions have the value 0.0.  When you
call this subprogram, you pass it a real-valued function as an argument,
and the subprogram finds where the function is zero.
     When you pass a function to a subprogram, the declaration of the func-
tion parameter in the subprogram's heading must be exactly the same as the
declaration of the function argument in the caller.
     A lot of built-in functions may NOT be passed as function arguments.
For example, "abs" and "sqr" may not be passed as function arguments
because they are defined in non-standard ways.

Function Parameter Examples:
     procedure zeroes( function func(arg:real):real );
         ...
     function f(x:real):real;
         ...
     zeroes(f);
