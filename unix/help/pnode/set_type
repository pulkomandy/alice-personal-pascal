     The set type is a special information type that is used for sets of
other types of information.  You can have sets of characters, integers, or
enumerated values.
     Pascal lets you find the intersection of sets (*), the union of sets
(+), and the difference of sets (-).  The "in" operator lets you determine
if a particular value happens to be inside a set.

Set Examples:
     type
         days = (sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat);
     var
         schedule : set of days;
     begin
     schedule := [mon..wed,fri];
     if thu in schedule then begin ...
