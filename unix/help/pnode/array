     An array is an ordered collection of things that all have the same
type.  The things in the collection are called the elements of the array.
The elements may be of any legal type.
     Individual elements are referenced by subscripts.  Subscripts can have
any "scalar type", but most arrays are subscripted using a subrange of the
integers.
     An array declaration tells ALICE the name of the array, the type of
elements in the array, and the subscripts you will use to reference
individual elements.

Array Declaration Examples:
     type
         scalar = (x,y,z);
         sarray = array [scalar] of integer;
     var
         ivec : array [0..10] of integer;
         table : array [char] of char;
         Boolist : array [1..100] of Boolean;
