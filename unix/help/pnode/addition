     An addition operation adds two numbers or expressions.  You can only
add numeric values (reals or integers).
     If one or both of the things being added are "real", the result of the
addition will be "real".  If both are integers, the result of the addition
will be "integer".
     The addition operator "+" is also used to obtain the union of two
sets.  The two sets must have compatible base types.

Valid Addition Examples:
     3+5     3.1+2.2     4.4+2     a+2     ['a'..'z']+['A'..'Z']
Invalid Addition Examples:
     'a'+2     (b>c)+4.3     [1,2,3]+['a'..'c']
