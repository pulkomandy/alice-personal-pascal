     IF will execute one or more statements provided a particular condition
is true.  The Condition that follows the word "if" tells what the condition
is.  It is almost always a relational condition.  In fact, the Condition
can be any that yields a Boolean (true/false) result.
     The statement(s) inside the BEGIN/END block will be executed if and
only if the Condition has a true result.
     IFs are frequently followed by ELSEs.  To create an ELSE, type the
keyword "else" anywhere inside the IF statement.

IF Examples:
     if a=1 then begin
         writeln('a equals 1!');
         end;
     if c >= d then begin
         pos = c - d;
         end;
