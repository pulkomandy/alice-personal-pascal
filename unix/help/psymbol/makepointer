     The "MakePointer" function obtains the actual memory address of its
argument.  The argument must be a variable name, a subscripted variable,
a field inside a record variable, or an indirectly-referenced variable.
The function returns a "Pointer" type that gives the machine address of the
storage that has been allocated for that variable.

MakePointer Examples:
     var
         p : ^integer;
         v : integer;
       ...
     p := MakePointer(v);
