     The "Get_Char" function gets a single character from the keyboard.

          c := Get_Char;

assigns a single character from the keyboard to the "char" variable "c".
     Users should avoid mixing calls to "Get_Char" and "Char_Waiting" with
calls to "readln", "get", "writeln", etc.

Get_Char Examples:
     c := StrEnd;
     {Search for a blank}
     while c <> ' ' do begin
         c := Get_Char;
         end;
