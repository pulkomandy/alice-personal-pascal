     The "Pointer" type is used for arbitrary memory pointers.  Values with
this type may be assigned to any kind of normal pointer type.  "Nil" is an
example of a "Pointer" value; it may be assigned to any other kind of
pointer.
     You may assign string constants to Pointer variables if you wish.  In
this case, ALICE creates the string in memory and returns a pointer to
where that string is stored.

Pointer Examples:
     var
         p : Pointer;
         i : integer;
         ip : ^integer;
       ...
     p := MakePointer(i);
     ip := p;
     p := "Hello";
