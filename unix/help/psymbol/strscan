     The StrScan function searches one string to see if it contains a
second string.  The first argument of the function is the string to search.
The second is the string to search for.  The function returns an integer
that gives the subscript inside the first string where the second string
begins.  If the second string is not found inside the first string, StrScan
returns the value 0.

StrScan Examples:
     StrScan('Hi there','the') = 4
     StrScan('Hi there','abc') = 0
