     The "random" function returns a random integer in a given range.
Before you can call "random", you must set things up with a call to the
"initrandom" procedure.

Random Examples:
     initrandom(345,6);
       {345 is arbitrary; 6 is range}
     dice := random + 1;
       {Get roll of six-sided die}
