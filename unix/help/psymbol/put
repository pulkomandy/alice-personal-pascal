     The "put" procedure is usually used to write an element to a file.
The argument of "put" is the file variable of the file you want to write
to.  If this argument is omitted, "put" will read "output".  The file
variable must be initialized with "rewrite", "append", or "update".
     When you call "put" on a file variable "f", ALICE will write the
current contents of "f^" to the file.  The value of "f^" then becomes
undefined.

Put Examples:
     var
         f : file of integer;
         i : integer;
      ...
     rewrite(f,'myfile');
     for i := 1 to 50 do begin
         f^ := i;
         put(f);
         end;
