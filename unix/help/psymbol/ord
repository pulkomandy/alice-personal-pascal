     The "ord" function can be applied to characters or enumerated types.
If its argument is a character, "ord" gives the integer whose bit
representation is the same as the character's ASCII representation.  If its
argument is an enumerated value, "ord" gives an integer that indicates the
position that the value had in the list that gave all the values in the
enumerated type.  The first value in the list is numbered 0, the next is
1, and so on.

Ord Examples:
     type
         days = (sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat);
     begin
         writeln(ord(sun),' is the integer 0.');
         writeln(ord(mon),' is the integer 1.');
         writeln(ord('b')-ord('a'),' is the integer 1.');
