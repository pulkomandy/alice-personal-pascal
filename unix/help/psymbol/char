     The "char" data type is a predefined type that consists of all the
printable and non-printable characters in the ASCII character set.  This
includes the upper and lower case letters, the digits, all the other
characters on the terminal keyboard, and many other characters that do not
have their own key.
     A "char" constant is written as a single character inside single quote
marks, as in 'a'.
