     "CIntFunc" calls a C function that returns an integer.  The first
argument of CIntFunc is an integer indicating the C function you want to
call.  The arguments that follow are the arguments for the C function.  The
value returned by CIntFunc is the value returned by the C function.
     Note that CIntFunc also gives you access to QNX calls that return an
integer.
     For further information on CIntFunc, see the ALICE Reference Manual.
