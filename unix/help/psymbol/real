     The "real" type is used for numbers that may have fractional parts.
These numbers can be positive or negative or zero.
     Pascal lets you add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/)
real numbers.  Integer values that are assigned to real variables will
automatically be converted into real values.  However, real values cannot
legally be assigned to integer variables.

Real Examples:
     var
         x, y, z : real;
     begin
     x := 3.0;
     y := x * -3.44;
     z := 4 + y / x;
