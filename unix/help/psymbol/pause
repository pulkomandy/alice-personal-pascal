     When ALICE has "Debug On" and it encounters a call to the "pause"
procedure, the effect is the same as if a breakpoint was triggered while
running the program.  The program will stop and wait for run-time commands
(e.g. going into immediate mode).
     If ALICE has "Debug Off", the "pause" procedure has no effect.
