     The "input" file variable is a special predefined file variable that
is usually associated with the terminal.  "input" is declared as a "text"
file.  "read" or "readln" instructions that do not specify a file variable
will read from "input".  You may use "reset" to associate "input" with a
file instead of the terminal.

Input Examples:
     program name(input,output);
           ...
     readln(x,y,z);
     {is the same as}
     readln(input,x,y,z);
