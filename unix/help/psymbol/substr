     The SubStr procedure copies part of one string into another string.
The first argument of SubStr is the string that contains the characters to
be copied.  This can be a string constant or variable.  The second argument
is an integer giving the number of characters to be copied.  The third
argument is another integer giving the subscript where copying should
begin.  The fourth argument is a string variable; this is where the
characters will be copied.

SubStr Examples:
     var
         str : packed array [1..10] of char;
     begin
     SubStr('abcdefg',2,3,str);
     writeln(str);
        {Will write out "cd"}
