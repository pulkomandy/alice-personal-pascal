     The "append" procedure associates a file with a file variable and sets
up the file for writing.  Information written to the file will be written
on the end of the file's current contents; it will NOT write over what is
already there.  If the file does not already exist, it will be created.
     If the "filename" argument is omitted, ALICE will use the name of the
file variable as the file name.

append Examples:
     var
         intfile : file of integer;
     begin
     append(intfile,'filename');
     write(intfile,1);
