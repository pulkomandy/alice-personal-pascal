     "Text" is a predefined type used for files that contain normal text
(lines of material that could be typed from the keyboard).  It is defined
as
          type
              text = file of char;
In other words, a text file is just a file of characters.
     Text files are special because you can use the routines "eoln",
"readln", and "writeln" on them.  You can also use "read" and "write" in
special ways.
     The predefined file variables "input" and "output" (attached to the
terminal) are declared to be text files.

Text Examples:
     var
         textfile : text;
         i : integer;
         r : real;
         c : char;
         s : string;
     begin
     reset(textfile,'filename');
     readln(textfile,i,r,c,s);
