     The "poke" procedure stores a byte at a particular location in memory.
"Poke" takes two arguments: the first is an integer giving the address
where you want to store the byte, and the second is an integer that holds
the byte itself.  Since the second is only supposed to represent a byte,
it should be in the range 0..255.  If it is not, its value will be taken
"mod 256".

Poke Examples:
     var
         i, v : integer;
     begin
     i := address(v);
     poke(i,200);
     writeln(peek(i),' is the value 200.');
