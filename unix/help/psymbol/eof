     The "eof" function tells you if you have reached the end of a file.
It is only useful with files that you are reading.
     The value returned by "eof" is "Boolean".  If this value is true, you
have reached the end of the file and you cannot read anything more.  If it
is false, you can read at least one more piece of data from the file.
     The argument of "eof" is the file variable that is associated with the
file you are reading.  If you do not give an argument, "eof" will check the
"input" file variable.
     Calling "eof" on "input" may cause the terminal to prompt for input if
no reads have taken place yet.

Eof Examples:
     var
         intfile : file of integer;
      ...
     while not( eof(intfile) ) do begin
         read(intfile,i);
         ...
         end;
