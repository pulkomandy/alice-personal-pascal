     The "address" function obtains the actual memory address of its argu-
ment.  The argument must be a variable name, a subscripted variable, a
field inside a record variable, or an indirectly-referenced variable.  The
function returns an integer that gives the machine address of the storage
that has been allocated for that variable.

Address Examples:
     i := address(v);
     i := address(rec.f);
     i := address(arr[j]);
