     The "new" procedure creates a new variable.  The first argument of
"new" is a pointer and the type of variable created will be the type of
variable that the pointer points to.  For example, if P is a pointer to
integers,

          new(P);

creates an integer variable and points P towards that variable.  In
traditional Pascal, if P points to a record type with a variant part, you
can add tag field values to the arguments of "new", and "new" will create
a record whose variant part is dictated by those tag field values.
However, ALICE always allocates memory big enough to hold the largest
variant.

New Examples:
     var
         pc : ^char;
     begin
     new(pc);
     pc^ := 'A';
