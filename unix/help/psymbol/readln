     "readln" works like "read" except for following differences.

   (a)  "readln" can only read from text files.
   (b)  "readln" always reads an entire line.  If there is more on the line
        than can be stored in the variable arguments given in the call to
        "readln", the surplus text is just discarded.
   (c)  When reading from the terminal, you may specify a string constant
        that prompts for input.
            readln('Enter an integer: ',i);
        causes the string
            Enter an integer:
        to be displayed on the terminal to tell the user what sort of input
        is desired.

Readln Examples:
     readln(filevar,x,y,z);
     while not eoln do begin
         read(c);
         write(c);
         end;
     readln;
