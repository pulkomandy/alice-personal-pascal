     The "write" procedure writes information to a file or to the terminal.
If you are writing to a file, the first argument should be a file variable
that has been set up with "rewrite".  If you are writing to the terminal,
you can omit this argument or you can specify the file variable "output".
     The other arguments of "write" are values that you want to write out.
If you are writing to a text file, these values may be characters,
integers, reals, strings, sets, or enumerated types.  If you are writing
to any other kind of file, the values must have the same type as the file
itself.  For example, if the file variable is declared as "file of
integer", the arguments of "write" must be integer values.

Write Examples:
     write(filevar,x,y,z);
     for i := 1 to StrLen(line) do begin
         write(line[i]);
         end;
     writeln;
     {Puts out new-line}
