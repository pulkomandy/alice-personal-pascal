     The "rewrite" procedure sets up a file for writing.

          rewrite(filevar,'filename');

associates the file named 'filename' with the given file variable.
Anything written to the file will be written over top of the file's current
contents.  If the file does not exist already, it will be created.
     If the file variable has already been associated with a file,

          rewrite(filevar);

will go back to the beginning of the file so you can start writing there
again.  This is useful if you must go through a file several times in the
same program.
     If the "filename" argument is omitted, "rewrite" will use the name of
the file variable as the file name.

Rewrite Examples:
     var
         intfile : file of integer;
     begin
     rewrite(intfile,'filename');
     write(intfile,i);
