     This procedure indicates that the next line written to a file of type
"text" should begin at the top of a new page.  (In other words, it writes
out an ASCII "formfeed" character, octal 014.)
     "Page" can take one argument, a file variable that has the type
"text".  If this argument is omitted, the standard "output" is used.  In
this case, the terminal screen will be cleared.

Page Examples:
     var
         t : text;
       ...
     page(t);
