     The "integer" data type stands for numbers without a decimal point or
exponent.  These numbers can be positive or negative or zero.
     The computer cannot accept integers that are too large or small.  The
largest possible integer is +32767 and the smallest is -32768.
     Pascal lets you add (+), subtract (-), and multiply (*) integers.
There are two types of division for integers: real division (/) divides two
integers and gets a real number; integer division (div) divides two
integers and gets an integer, by throwing away any remainder that is found.
The "mod" operation is the partner of "div" -- it gives the remainder that
results when two integers are divided.

Integer Examples:
     var
         i, j, k : integer;
     begin
     i := -5;
     j := i * 4;
     k := i div j + i mod j;
