     The StrSize function determines the maximum length of a string and
returns this length as an integer.  For a string constant, this is the
number of characters in the string.  For a string variable, this is the
largest number of characters that the variable could hold.
     StrSize is the same as the Sizeof function.

StrSize Examples:
     var
         str : packed array [1..10] of char;
     begin
     str := 'abc';
     writeln(StrSize(str));
        {Will write out integer 10}
     writeln('xxxx');
        {Will write out integer 4}
