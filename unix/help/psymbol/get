     The "get" procedure is usually used to read an element from a file.
The argument of "get" is the file variable of the file you want to read.
If this argument is omitted, "get" will read "input".  You will get an
error if the file you try to read was not initialized with "reset".
     If "eof" is true on the file you are trying to read, you will get an
error if you call "get" on that file.  Otherwise, ALICE advances the
current position of the file by one element and "f^" receives the value of
the new current element.  "Get" will set "eof" true if there is no next
element, and will set "eoln" true if you are reading a text file and you
have reached the end of a line.

Get Examples:
     var
         f : file of integer;
         i : integer;
       ...
     reset(f,'myfile');
     get(f);
     i := f^;
