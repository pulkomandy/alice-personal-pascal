     The ISysCall function is the same as the SysFunc function.  ISysCall
is used to call an assembler language or library routine.  The first argu-
ment must be an integer value that gives the address of the routine to be
called.  After this come a maximum of ten other arguments to be passed to
the routine being called.  The value returned by ISysCall is an integer
indicating the value returned by the invoked routine.
     Further details about this subprogram may be found in the ALICE
Reference Manual.

ISysCall Examples:
     i := ISysCall(routine,arg1,arg2,...,arg10);
