     The "writeln" procedure writes information to a text file or the
terminal.  If you are writing to a text file, the first argument should be
a file variable that has been set up with "rewrite".  If you are writing
to the terminal, you can omit this argument or you can specify the file
variable "output".
     The other arguments of "writeln" are values that you want to write
out.  These values may be characters, integers, reals, strings, sets, or
enumerated types.  When "writeln" has written all these values, it will
automatically write a new-line character to end this line of text and get
set for a new output line.  If you do not want this automatic new-line, use
the "write" procedure.

Writeln Examples:
     writeln(filevar,x,y,z);
     for i := 1 to StrLen(line) do begin
         write(line[i]);
         end;
     writeln;
     {Puts out new-line}
