     The "eoln" function tells you if you have reached the end of an input
line of text.  The value returned by "eoln" is Boolean.  If this value is
true, you have reached the end of the line and must do a "readln" before
you can read a new line.  If it is false, you can read at least one more
character from the line.
     The argument of "eoln" is the file variable that is associated with
the text file you are reading.  If you do not give an argument, "eoln" will
check the "input" file variable (usually associated with input from the
terminal).  The argument must be a file of the "text" type.
     Calling "eoln" on "input" may cause the terminal to prompt for input
if no reads have taken place yet.

Eoln Examples:
     for count := 1 to 80 do begin
         if not(eoln) then begin
             read(line[count]);
             end;
         else begin
             readln;
             end;
         end;
