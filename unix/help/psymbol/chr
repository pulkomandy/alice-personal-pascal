     The "chr" function takes an integer as an argument and returns the
ASCII character that has the same bit representation as the integer.  This
is the inverse of the "ord" function, which can be used to convert
characters to integers.

Chr Examples:
     i := ord('a');
     c := chr(i + 1);
     writeln(c,' is the letter b.');
