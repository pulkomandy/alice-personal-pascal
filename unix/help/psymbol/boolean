     The Boolean data type is a predefined enumerated type that is set up
with type

              Boolean = (false,true);

All comparisons (=, <>, <, >, <=, >=) return Boolean values.  The operators
"and" and "or" can be used to join two Boolean values together into one
Boolean expression.  The "not" operator reverses the value of a Boolean
expression (so that "true" becomes "false", and "false" becomes "true").
