     The "reset" procedure sets up a file for reading.

          reset(filevar,'filename');

associates the file named 'filename' with the given file variable.  Reading
will begin at the start of the file.  An error will be issued if the file
is empty.
     If the file variable has already been associated with a file,

          reset(filevar);

will go back to the beginning of the file so you can start reading it
again.  This is useful if you must go through a file several times in the
same program.
     If the "filename" argument is omitted, "reset" will use the name of
the file variable as the file name.

Reset Examples:
     var
         intfile : file of integer;
     begin
     reset(intfile,'filename');
     read(intfile,i);
