Var_To_Mem( variable, offset, segment )

This procedure copies the contents of a variable to anywhere in the
address space of an IBM-PC.  It is mainly intended for use in the SMALL
model version of ALICE where RawPointer cannot be used for this
purpose.  The offset and segment must be specified and are integers.
The resulting address is equal to 'segment*16 + offset' in the 8086
style.  Large amounts of memory may be moved quickly by copying whole
arrays and records.  Whether the memory has been initialized is NOT
checked.

THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED IN THE CURRENT ICON RELEASE
