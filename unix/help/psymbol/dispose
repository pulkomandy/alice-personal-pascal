     The "dispose" procedure does away with a variable that was created by
the "new" procedure.  "Dispose" either takes a pointer value argument
(originally returned by "new"), or it takes a pointer and a list of tag
field values.  The arguments for "dispose" must be identical to the argu-
ments for "new" that originally created the object.
     The current implementation of ALICE does not free up "disposed"
memory.  This will be corrected in a future release.

Dispose Examples:
     type
         rec = record ... end;
     var
         rptr = ^ rec;
     begin
     new( rptr );
     dispose( rptr );
