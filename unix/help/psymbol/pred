     The "pred" function is the partner of "succ".  "Pred" may be applied
to any enumerated value, character, or integer.  If it is applied to an
integer, the result is the integer minus 1.  If it is applied to a
character, the result is the character that comes before the argument in
the ASCII character set.
     If it is applied to an enumerated value, the result is the value that
comes before the argument in the list that set up the enumerated type.  If
you try to apply "pred" to the first value in the list, you will receive
an error, because nothing in the list precedes the value.

Valid Pred Examples:
     type
         days = (sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat);
        ...
     pred(mon) is equal to "sun"
     pred('b') is equal to 'a'
     pred(3) is equal to 2
Invalid Pred Examples:
     pred(sun)  {Nothing comes before "sun"}
