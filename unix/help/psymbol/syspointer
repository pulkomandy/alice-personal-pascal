     The "SysPointer" function returns a Pointer type value pointing to a
value used by the system.  The argument for SysPointer is an integer
indicating which system value you want.  For example, SysPointer(3) returns
the address of where the ALICE cursor is stored.  Through this pointer, you
may find out the value or even change it.  SysPointer(8) returns the
address of an integer indicating what kind of computer you are using: a 1
indicates the IBM PC under DOS, a 2 indicates the Cemcorp ICON under QNX,
and a 4 indicates the IBM PC under QNX.
     Further details about this subprogram may be found in the ALICE
Reference Manual.
