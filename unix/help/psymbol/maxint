     "maxint" is a predefined constant standing for the largest integer
that the computer can accept.  This happens to be +32767, but it is better
to use "maxint" than the actual number, since other computers may have
different limits on the size of integers that they can accept.

Maxint Examples:
     if a < (maxint/2) then begin
         a := 2 * a;
         end;
     else begin
         writeln('Cannot double "a".');
         end;
