     The StrLen function determines the length of a string and returns this
length as an integer.  For a string constant, this is the number of
characters in the string.  For a string variable, this is the number of
characters in the string that the variable currently holds.

StrLen Examples:
     var
         str : packed array [1..10] of char;
     begin
     str := 'abc';
     writeln(StrLen(str));
        {Will write out integer 3}
     writeln('xxxx');
        {Will write out integer 4}
