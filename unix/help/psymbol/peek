     The "peek" function lets you peek into memory and see what is there.
The argument of "peek" is an integer that stands for a memory address.  The
value returned by "peek" is an integer that holds the value of the byte
that was at the given address.  Since this is only a byte, the value will
be in the range 0..255.

Peek Examples:
     var
         i, v : integer;
     begin
     i := address(v);
     poke(i,200);
     writeln(peek(i),' is the value 200.');
