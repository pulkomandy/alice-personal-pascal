     "CPtrFunc" calls a C function that returns a pointer.  The first argu-
ment of CPtrFunc is an integer indicating the C function you want to call.
The arguments that follow are the arguments for the C function.  The value
returned by CPtrFunc is the pointer returned by the C function.  This has
the Pascal "Pointer" type.
     Note that CPtrFunc also gives you access to QNX calls that return a
pointer.
     For further information on CPtrFunc, see the ALICE Reference Manual.
