     The "succ" function is the partner of "pred".  "Succ" may be applied
to any enumerated value, character, or integer.  If it is applied to an
integer, the result is the integer plus 1.  If it is applied to a
character, the result is the character that comes after the argument in the
ASCII character set.
     If it is applied to an enumerated value, the result is the value that
comes after the argument in the list that set up the enumerated type.  If
you try to apply "succ" to the last value in the list, you will receive an
error, because nothing in the list comes after the value.

Valid Succ Examples:
     type
         days = (sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat);
        ...
     succ(mon) is equal to "tue"
     succ('a') is equal to 'b'
     succ(3) is equal to 4
Invalid Succ Examples:
     succ(sat)  {Nothing comes after "sat"}
