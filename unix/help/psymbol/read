     "read" reads information from a file or the terminal.  To read a file,
the first argument should be a file variable that was set up with "reset".
To read the terminal, you can omit this argument or specify "input".
     The other arguments of "read" are variables that will receive informa-
tion that is read in.  If you are reading a text file, these variables may
hold characters, integers, reals, or strings.  If you are reading any other
kind of file, the variables must have the same type as the file itself.
For example, if the file variable is declared as "file of integer", the
arguments must be integer variables.
     Reading a character from a text file, "read" will read the next
character on the line.  Reading a real or integer, "read" will skip over
blanks then keep reading until it finds something that can't belong to the
number.  Reading a string, "read" will read until the string is full or the
end of line has been reached.

Read Examples:
     read(filevar,x,y,z);
     for i := 1 to 80 do begin
         if not eoln then begin
             read(line[i]);
             end;
         end;
