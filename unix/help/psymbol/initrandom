     The "initrandom" procedure must be called before using "random" to
generate random numbers.  It is called with

          initrandom(seed,range);

where both "seed" and "range" are integers.  "Seed" can be any integer and
is used to start the random progression.  Starting with the same seed will
yield the same sequence of random numbers.  The random numbers will be
chosen in the range from zero to "range-1".

Initrandom Examples:
     initrandom(345,6);
       {345 is arbitrary; 6 is range}
     dice := random + 1;
       {Get roll of six-sided dice}
