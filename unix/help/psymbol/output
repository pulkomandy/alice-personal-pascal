     The "output" file variable is a special predefined file variable that
is usually associated with the terminal.  "output" is declared as a "file
of text".  "write" or "writeln" instructions that do not specify a file
variable will write to "output".
     The "rewrite" and "append" functions may be used to associated
"output" with a file instead of the terminal.

Output Examples:
     program name(input,output);
           ...
     writeln(x,y,z);
     {is the same as}
     readln(output,x,y,z);
