     The "RawPointer" function converts an address expressed as an integer
into a Pointer type.  On the ICON, RawPointer takes a single integer argu-
ment giving an absolute machine address (like the one returned by
"address").  The value returned by RawPointer has the "Pointer" type.

RawPointer Examples:
     var
         p : Pointer;
         i : integer;
       ...
     i := address(x);
     p := RawPointer(i);
