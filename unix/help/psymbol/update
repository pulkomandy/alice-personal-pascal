     This procedure initializes a file for reading and writing with direct
access.  The full form is

          update(fvar,filename)

where "fvar" is a file variable and "filename" is a string giving the name
of a file.  The named file will be associated with the file variable, and
the file will be positioned so that reading or writing will take place at
the beginning of the file.

Update Examples:
     var
         f : file of integer;
      ...
     update(f,'myfile');
