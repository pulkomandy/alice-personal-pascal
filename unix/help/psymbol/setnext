     "Setnext" is used to position a file that has been opened for direct
access reading and writing.  It is called with

          setnext(fvar,number);

where "fvar" is a file variable that has been initialized with the "update"
procedure and "number" is an integer.  The integer gives the number of the
element in the file to which the next "get" or put" is to apply.  The first
element in the file is number zero.

Setnext Examples:
     var
         f : file of integer;
      ...
     update(f,'myfile');
     setnext(f,4);
        { Will read fifth element in file }
