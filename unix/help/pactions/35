     Selecting this expands the current list by adding an empty placeholder
immediately after the current node.  The placeholder will be the same type
as the the current node.  For example, if the current node is a statement,
the empty placeholder will be a Statement placeholder.  If the current node
is a name in a variable declaration list, the placeholder will be another
Name placeholder.
