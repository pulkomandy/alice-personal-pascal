     Selecting this lets you enter an identifier on a Statement
placeholder.  If the identifier is the name of a variable, ALICE will
expand the line into an assignment statement and fill in the input
identifier as the variable on the left side of the assignment.  If the
identifier is the name of a procedure, ALICE will expand the line into a
procedure call (to the named procedure).  If the identifier is the name of
something inappropriate (e.g. a named type), ALICE will give an error.  If
the identifier is an undeclared name, ALICE will give an "undefined
variable" error and set up an assignment using the identifier as the
variable on the left hand side.
