current declaration or statement.  The location depends on the thing you're

will go to the Finish location in a FOR statement laid out as

          for Variable := Start to Finish do begin

Essentially the user can type in any token that makes sense in the current
context, and ALICE will move the cursor to whatever follows that token.
