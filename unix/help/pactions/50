     Selecting this changes an assignment of the form

          N := Value;

into a procedure call of the form

          N(Value);

This is only used when the name "N" was an undeclared name typed in on a
Statement placeholder.  When such an undeclared name is entered, ALICE
normally gives you an assignment; but this action will give you a procedure
call if you wish.
