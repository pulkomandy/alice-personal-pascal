     This action occurs if you are on the declaration of an array and type
a comma in the Range placeholder of the declaration.  The comma indicates
that the array will have more than one subscript (i.e. it is multi-
dimensional).  The action therefore changes the usual

          array [Range] of Type;

set up to

          array [Range] of array [Range] of Type;

to accommodate the multi-dimensional nature of the array.
