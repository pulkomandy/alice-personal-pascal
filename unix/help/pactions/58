     When you select this, the cursor will be on the beginning of a block
(e.g. the first line of a WHILE loop or procedure declaration).  ALICE will
create an empty placeholder of the same type as the first placeholder
inside the block.  Thus, if you are at the beginning of a procedure
declaration, ALICE will create another {Comment} placeholder.  If you are
at the beginning of a WHILE loop, ALICE will create another Statement
placeholder at the beginning of the block.
