     A label number placeholder should be filled in with a label that has
been declared in the LABEL declaration of your program or subprogram.  This
label will be an integer with no more than four digits.
     Label numbers are used to label instructions so you can go to them
with a GOTO instruction.  As a general rule, you should try to avoid the
use of GOTOs in your programs -- they make the logic of your program hard
to follow.  Whenever you are tempted to use a GOTO, first ask yourself if
there is a more elegant way to express what you want to do, using such
statements as FOR or WHILE.
