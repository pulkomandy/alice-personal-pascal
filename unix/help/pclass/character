     A character constant is written as a single character inside single
quote marks, as in 'a'.  This sort of constant has the type "char".
     If you want a character constant that holds a single quote, you must
type TWO single quotes inside the other quotes, for a total of four quotes.

Character Constant Examples:
     c := 'A';
     quote := '''';
     writeln('The single quote character is ',quote);
