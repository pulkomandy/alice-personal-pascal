     A constant can be a number, a character, or a string of characters.
     Numbers can be "integer" or "real".  An integer is a number without a
decimal point.  A real number has a decimal point.  There must be at least
one digit before the decimal point.  This means that 0.5 is correct, while
.5 is not.  Negative real and integer values have a leading minus sign.
     Real numbers may have accompanying exponents.  An exponent comes
immediately after the main part of the number and begins with the letter
"E".  After the "E" can be a positive or negative integer.
     Character constants are single characters surrounded by single quotes,
as in 'a'.  String constants have one or more characters surrounded by
single or double quotes, as in 'hi there' or "hello".  "" is a special
string constant with zero characters.
