     In Pascal, names are used to refer to variables, subprograms, data
types, and constants that have been declared in the CONST section of a
program or subprogram.  Names may consist of any number of letters, digits,
or underscores (_), with no blanks in the middle.  The first character of
a name may not be a digit.
     The letters may be either upper case or lower case, but ALICE
considers upper case letters to be the same as lower case.  Therefore,
NAME, name, Name, and nAMe are all the same thing as far as ALICE is
concerned.
     Certain words cannot be used as names because they already have spe-
cial meanings in Pascal.  These are known as "keywords".  Some examples of
keywords are IF, VAR, BEGIN, and RECORD.  You will be given an error if you
try to use a keyword as an ordinary name.

Valid Name Examples:
     hello     name     b2     veryverylongname
Invalid Name Examples:
     2b     bad.character     begin
