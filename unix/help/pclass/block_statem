     A Block Statement placeholder in ALICE stands for any sort of
construct that can contain other statements: WHILE loops, IF statements,
etc.  This placeholder is produced by the ENCLOSE command.  To fill in a
Block Statement placeholder, type the keyword that starts the statement you
want (e.g. "while", "if"), and ALICE will lay out the appropriate kind of
enclosing statement.
