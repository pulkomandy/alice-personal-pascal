     A Type-Name placeholder should be filled in with one of the valid
named types of Pascal, or with the name of the user-defined type.
     Predefined named types include integer, real, char, Boolean, and text
plus ALICE's own Pointer, Generic and Byte.  Hit the End key on this
placeholder for a list of available types, and use the HELP (F9) key on
the builtin ones.
