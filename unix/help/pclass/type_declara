     A Type Declaration placeholder appears in the TYPE section of a Pascal
program or subprogram.  To begin filling in the placeholder, enter a name
that you want to associate with a data type.  For example, you might fill
in "MONEY" because you want to create the declaration

          type
              MONEY = real; {Used for money sums}

The name becomes a new type that can be used in declarations for variables,
subprograms, and other types.
     You can perform the same sort of operations on the named type that you
could perform on the type associated with the name.  For example, you could
perform the same operations on "money" that you could on "real" variables.
However, "money" variables are a different type than "real" variables, and
ALICE makes sure you don't intermix them illegally.
