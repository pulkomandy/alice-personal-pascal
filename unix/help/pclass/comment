     A comment placeholder should be filled in with a description of what
your program is doing.  Even though comments do not affect how the program
runs, they are an important part of it.  Comments make it easier for
someone reading your program to understand it.
     ALICE Pascal requires comments at the beginning of every program (to
explain what the program does), at the beginning of every procedure and
function (to explain what they do), and at the end of every declaration (to
describe what the thing being defined will be used for).  ALICE also lets
you put a comment anywhere that you would normally put a statement or
declaration.  Simply type an opening brace bracket and ALICE will put out
the standard comment template.

Comment Examples:
     { This program sorts data. }
     var
         str : packed array[1..100] of char; { Character string }
