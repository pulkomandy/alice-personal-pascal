     A Pascal program is a complete set of instructions telling the
computer how to perform a certain job.  The PROGRAM statement gives the
program's name and lists the file variables the program will use.  The ini-
tial comment describes what the program does.  The Declarations tell what
names you are going to use in your program.  These names can be labels,
constants, types, or variables, or they may be subprograms (procedures and
functions).  The Statements are the actual instructions that tell the
computer what to do.

Program Examples:
     program squares (input,output);
     { Print First Ten Perfect Squares }
     var
         i : integer;
     begin
     for i := 1 to 10 do begin
         writeln(i*i);
         end;
     end.
