     A Value placeholder should be filled with a constant, a variable, or
an expression.  Expressions are made up of variables, constants, and
operators.  All expressions have results, and every result has a type.
Results can be integer, real, Boolean, or some other type defined within
the program.
     There are many kinds of operators used in Pascal expressions.  The
list below gives their names and the symbol that represents each operation.
For a description of any of them, just enter the symbol at an Value
placeholder and press HELP.
