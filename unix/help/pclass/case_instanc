     A Case-Instance placeholder appears inside a CASE statement.  It may
be filled in with a case label or the keyword ELSE.
     A case label is a scalar constant whose type matches the type of the
variable that follows the keyword CASE at the beginning of the CASE state-
ment.  If you enter such a constant, ALICE will lay out
          C: begin
             Statement
             end;
where C represents the constant you entered.  The Statement placeholder
should be filled with statements to be executed if the variable that
follows the keyword CASE matches the constant C.
     If you enter ELSE, you get an ELSE clause.  This will be executed if
the variable that follows the keyword CASE does not match any of the others.

Case Instances Examples:
     case t mod 3 of
         0: writeln('Divisible
		   by three');
         else begin
             writeln('Not
	     divisible by three');
         end;
     end;
