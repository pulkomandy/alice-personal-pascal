     To fill in a Constant Declaration placeholder, you enter a name that
will be associated with a particular constant.  This sets up a constant
declaration.
     Constant declarations appear in the CONST declaration section of a
program or subprogram.  Once a constant has been associated with a name,
the name may be used anywhere that the value of the constant would be
valid.
     Named constants are used to make your program easier to understand and
easier to change.

Constant Declaration Examples:
     const
         PI = 3.14159;
         SIZE = 100;
         DOLLAR = '$';
