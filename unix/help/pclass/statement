     A Statement placeholder may be filled with a symbol indicating any of
the possible statements in Pascal.  Often you will fill it in with a
keyword like WHILE or IF.  An assignment may be indicated by "=" or ":=",
or by typing a variable name.  A procedure call may be indicated by typing
the procedure's name.  A comment is created
by typing "{".  Typing "?" creates a
"writeln" instruction.  You may also put a
statement label in the Statement placeholder.
