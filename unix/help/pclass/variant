     A Variant placeholder stands for the variant part of a record.  To
fill in a Variant placeholder, you should enter a constant that is one of
the possible values of the variant tag field.  ALICE will lay out the
template

          C: (Field);

where C is the constant you entered.  The field(s) inside the parentheses
will be the fields that the record contains when the tag field has the
value C.  For example, in a record holding information about books, we
might have

          case English : Boolean of
          true : (Canadian : Boolean);
          false : (language : packed array [1..20] of char;
                   translator : packed array [1..40] of char);

This has two Variants, labelled "true" and
"false".  The "tag field" is a Boolean
field named "English".
