Can't expand list any further
    You attempted to expand a list beyond the limits that ALICE can handle.
    In ALICE, lists (such as lists of statements or declarations) can have
    a maximum of 255 elements.  Lists of this length are unlikely to occur
    in most programs.
         If you have a list of more than 255 statements, you can get around
    the problem by enclosing some of the statements with "begin" and "end".
    This makes a block that counts as only one statement in the list.
         If you have a list of more than 255 declarations, the easiest
    solution is to hide some of the declarations.  A hidden block of
    declarations only counts as one element in the list.
