Input Error - Number too long
    You were attempting to read a number with "read" or "readln", but the
    first number that ALICE found had too many digits for ALICE to accept.
    For example, suppose the input line consisted of twenty digits.  This
    is much too large to store in a normal integer, and ALICE will give you
    this message.  (integers must fall in the range -32768 to 32767).
