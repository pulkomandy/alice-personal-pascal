Nothing to redo
    You tried to issue the REDO command, but you haven't used UNDO yet.
    The error also occurs if you UNDO something, make some changes to your
    program, then try the REDO command.  REDO can only be used immediately
    after an UNDO.  (If you issued the REDO by accident, don't worry --
    nothing happened.)
