The selected item must be a list of statements
    You have selected (highlighted) a part of your program and then issued
    a command.  However, the command you issued only works on a list of
    statements, and you have selected something else (either a part of a
    statement or some declarations).  Either issue a different command or
    reselect the part of the program that you want to change.
