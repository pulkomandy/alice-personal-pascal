I/O argument is not of the same type as given file
    You attempted to use "read" or "readln" to read a value from a file
    into a variable.  However, the type of the variable was not the same as
    the type of the file.  For example,

          var
              intfile : file of integer;
              c : char;
           ...
          read(intfile,c);

    would receive this error message.  Check the declarations for both the
    file and the variable.  If both are what they should be, you will have
    to read the value into a different variable of the correct type.
