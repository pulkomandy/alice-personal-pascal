Sorry, unable to continue running the program
    You receive this message when you have a suspended program and you
    attempt to continue execution of the program.  The message indicates
    that ALICE cannot resume program execution.
         The usual reason for this is that the program was suspended
    because it had an error in it.  ALICE will not resume execution of a
    program that has already been found to be incorrect.  The error may
    also be given if you have changed something in the program since the
    program was suspended.
         The only thing you can do in this case is to sweep away the
    suspended program using the POP command and start running the program
    again.
