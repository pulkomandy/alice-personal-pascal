You are running out of memory. Save your work and reload.
    As the message says, you have come close to filling up the memory of
    your computer.  This may be a problem with ALICE or it may just mean
    that you have too many things in too many workspaces.  It is imperative
    that you save your program(s) in files and quit immediately, since it
    is only a matter of time before ALICE runs out of memory and aborts.
         If you have trouble saving your workspaces, issue the RECOVER
    command to try to get some memory back.  However, only do this if you
    have trouble saving.  If you were using several workspaces before,
    don't load them all back in when you restart ALICE, or you'll just end
    up with the same problem again.
