Unknown command
    You typed a command that ALICE didn't recognize.  This should only
    happen when you have entered a command by pressing CTRL-X, then typing
    the command in words.  Possibly you just misspelled the command you
    wanted; if so, retype the command and try again.  You could also ask
    for Help on ALICE commands or ask ALICE for a Command Menu.
         If the error arose when you weren't entering a command in this
    way, it is possible that you have set up a macro incorrectly.
