Operands of AND/OR must be Boolean
    As the message says, you can only use the "and" and "or" operators on
    Boolean (true/false) values.  The most common cause of this error is
    leaving out parentheses around things that are being joined with "and"
    or "or".  For example, this message is issued when you say

          if c >= 'a' and c <= 'z' then begin ...

    because you really need parentheses around the two comparisons.

          if (c >= 'a') and (c <= 'z') then begin ...
