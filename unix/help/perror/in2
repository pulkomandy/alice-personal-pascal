IN: Types of set and member don't match
    You tried to use the "in" operator to determine if a particular value
    was a member of a set.  However, the value didn't have the same base
    type as the set.  As an example, this error occurs if you try to see if
    3 is in the set ['a','b','c'].  Change the IN expression so that the
    types match.
