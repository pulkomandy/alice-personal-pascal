SubStr: requested substring beyond bounds of string
    In a call to the SubStr procedure, the substring you tried to get went
    past the end of the string.  For example, in

          SubStr("abc",4,1,str2);

    you try to obtain four characters from a string "abc" that only has
    three characters in it.  Check the size of your second argument (the
    number of characters you want to pick up) and the third argument (the
    subscript of the first character to pick up).  One of these is likely
    too big.
