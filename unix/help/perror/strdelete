StrDelete: Attempt to delete past end of string: Offset NUMBER
    In a call to the StrDelete procedure, you attempted to delete
    characters that weren't there.  Check the two integers passed to the
    procedure (arguments 2 and 3).  Argument number 2 is the number of
    characters to be deleted; argument number 3 is the subscript of the
    first character to be deleted.  One of these is likely too big.
