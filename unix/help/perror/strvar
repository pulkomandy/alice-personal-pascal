NAME must be a string variable
    The given NAME is the name of a variable that is passed as an argument
    to a built-in subprogram for manipulating strings.  NAME is not the
    right kind of variable -- it should be a "packed array of char".
    Either change the declaration of the variable or use a different
    variable.
