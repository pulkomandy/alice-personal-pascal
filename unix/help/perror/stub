Error - program is not finished yet
    You tried to run the program before an important placeholder was filled
    in.  When the program stops execution, the cursor should be located on
    the placeholder that was not filled in.  Fill it in and try again.
         Note that if your program is suspended because of this error, you
    will have to use the POP command to sweep away the suspended program
    before you can run it again.
