Cannot find a list to expand
    You have used the one of the ALICE commands that is supposed to expand
    a list, but the cursor is not on a list that can be expanded.  If you
    issued the expansion command by accident, don't worry -- nothing
    happened.  If you really wanted to issue the command, move the cursor
    so it is on something that is part of a list (e.g. a statement, a
    declaration, or a list inside a statement or declaration).
