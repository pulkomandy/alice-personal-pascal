Array index out of bounds
    While it was executing, your program tried to subscript an array with a
    value that went outside the bounds set on the array's subscripts.  This
    value could have been too low or too high.  ALICE will indicate the
    statement where the error occurred.  Look at this statement and the
    statements that surround it.  How did the subscript take on the value
    it has?  How can you stop it from taking on this value?  Single-
    stepping through the program will help determine where the bug is.
