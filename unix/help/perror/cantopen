Can't open FILE, file not saved
    You tried to save your program in a file named FILE, but for one reason
    or another, ALICE couldn't use that file.  The most common reason for
    this is that the file already exists and contains a different kind of
    information than an ALICE program.  ALICE can only save programs in
    files that have a particular format, and if the save file doesn't have
    that format, ALICE won't write your program into that file.  Another
    possible cause for this error is that you don't have permissions to
    write into the file you named.
         It's important to note that this error message means that your
    program has NOT been saved.  You must save your program in a different
    file before you quit.  Use the FILENAME command to specify a new save
    file, then try the save command again.
