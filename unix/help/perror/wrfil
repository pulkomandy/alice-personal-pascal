    This message may be issued for a variety of reasons when you are trying
    to use "rewrite", "reset", "append" or "update" to initialize a file
    variable.  There are many possible causes.  The most straightforward
    cause is that the file you named could not be found.  You may have
    spelled the name wrong or the file may not be there for one reason or
    another.  Another possible reason for this message is that you do not
    have permissions on the specified file.  Finally, the file may be
