Invalid subset range NUMBER to NUMBER
(And variations on this message)
    You used an invalid range inside a set constant.  This could mean that
    the range was improperly formed (e.g. in the wrong order, as in 10..1)
    or that the range given inside the set fell outside the limits for the
    set.  It can also occur if the two limits of the range do not have the
    same type (as in 1..'a').
