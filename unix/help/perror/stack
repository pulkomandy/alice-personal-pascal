Runtime stack overflow - out of memory
    The program ran out of memory while it was executing.  One common cause
    of this is allocating an array that is too big to fit in the memory
    that is currently available.  It may also happen if you have a lot of
    recursion in your program.  Check the status line for the program to
    see how many subprogram calls are currently stacked up.  If it's a high
    number, consider using the TRACEBACK command to see what those
    subprograms are.  It's possible you have an infinite recursion loop.
         You can get more memory for your program through the RECOVER
    command, or by saving your files, quitting ALICE, and starting back up
    again with the line
          alice s=6000
    The "s=" option increases the amount of "stack" space for ALICE.  The
    default value for stack space is 5000 bytes.  The above command line
    gives 6000 bytes.  You can specify even more stack space for large
    programs, by specifying a higher number than 6000.
