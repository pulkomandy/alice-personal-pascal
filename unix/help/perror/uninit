Attempt to use a variable that has not been assigned to
    All variables, no matter what type they are, must be given values
    before they can be used.  For example, you can't use an expression
    "i+2" unless "i" has been given a value.  Similarly, you cannot pass a
    variable as an argument to a subprogram until it has been given a
    value.
         The way to give a value to a normal variable is to use an assign-
    ment.  The same goes for a set variable, and elements in an array.
    Pointers are given values with assignments or the "new" procedure.
         When passing a record as an argument to a subprogram, some of the
    fields in the record may be undefined.  However, you will get an error
    if the subprogram tries to use those undefined fields.
