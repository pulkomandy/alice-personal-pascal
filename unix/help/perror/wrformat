Improper use of format specifier (colons)
    This error occurs if you use the ":" operator inside any expression
    that is not an argument to "write" or "writeln" (or some other
    subprogram).  In "write" and "writeln", the colon is used to indicate
    field widths and precision, as in

          writeln(a:8:5);

    Elsewhere, they are illegal.  One deceptive way of getting this error
    is to start with something like

          writeln(a:8)

    and edit the "8" into "8:5".  You must highlight the full expression
    "a:8" and edit that.
