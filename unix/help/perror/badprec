Output precision must be integer
    In a "write" or "writeln" function, you gave a precision for a real
    value, but the precision wasn't an integer.  In other words, if you
    wrote

          writeln(r:A:B);

    the value B was not an integer.  Only an integer can be accepted for a
    precision.
