New - out of memory
    You attempted to use the "new" procedure to obtain memory for
    something, but there was not enough memory available to do this for
    you.  This does not mean that you have used up all the memory in the
    computer.  "New" obtains space from a limited area within ALICE called
    the stack.  Too many calls to "new" will use up all this stack area and
    you will get this error.
         To avoid this problem, you must add a special option when you
    start ALICE up.  You must say
          alice s=N
    where N is some large number.  The "s=" option tells ALICE how much
    space should be set aside for the stack area.  ALICE starts out with a
    stack space of 5000 bytes, so if you get this error message you should
    say something like "s=6000" (giving you 1000 more bytes of stack
    space).  If the problem still does not go away, make sure you aren't in
    an infinite loop that keeps on using "new" forever.
         Note that the "dispose" procedure does not free up stack space in
    this version of ALICE -- this makes
    life safer for beginning programmers.
