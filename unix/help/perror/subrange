Value NUMBER is not in subrange bounds for this assignment
    In an assignment, you attempted to assign NUMBER to a variable.
    However, the variable was declared with a subrange type and the NUMBER
    you assigned was outside this subrange.  For example, you might have

          var
              i : 1..10;
            ...
          i := 12;

    Either change the declaration to expand the subrange or determine why
    the assigned value fell outside the proper subrange.
         Note that this error can also crop up when you use subranges
    inside sets.
