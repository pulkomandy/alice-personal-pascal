Conversion Error
(And variations of this message)
    You were using APIN to convert a Pascal program in text format to the
    special program format that ALICE uses, but for some reason, APIN
    couldn't perform the conversion.  There are many reasons why this could
    happen.  You may have made an error in entering the name of the file
    you wanted to convert.  There may also have been insufficient memory to
    perform the conversion.  The best solution is to quit ALICE and try to
    use the APIN program on its own.
