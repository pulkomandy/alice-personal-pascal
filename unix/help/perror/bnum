Badly formed number NUMBER on input
(And variations of this message) You were attempting to read a number with
    "read" or "readln", but the first input item that ALICE found did not
    have the right format for a number.  For example, you might have tried

          readln(i);

    to read an integer, but the input was the letter "A".  Since this is
    not a proper number, ALICE will give you this error.
