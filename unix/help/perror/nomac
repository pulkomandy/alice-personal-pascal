Not enough key-macros defined.  Press ESC to quit.
    When ALICE started up, it found that you had less than 10 key-macros
    defined.  This usually means that ALICE couldn't find the standard
    "init file" that defines all the default key bindings.
         When this error occurs, ALICE automatically creates three key
    bindings.  ESC is bound to the EXIT command, HELP is bound to HELP, and
    CTRL-X is set up as the "command" key.
