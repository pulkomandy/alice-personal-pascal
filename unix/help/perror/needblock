You may only raise a block statement
    You selected (highlighted) a part of your program and then issued the
    RAISE command.  However, the highlighted code was not a block (i.e.
    something that contains a set of statements, like a WHILE loop or IF
    statement).  If you issued the RAISE command by accident, simply
    unselect the highlighted code by pressing F10 again, or choose a
    different command.  If you really want to raise something, you must
    select an entire block.
