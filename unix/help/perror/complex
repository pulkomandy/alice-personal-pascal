Nasty error - expression or program too complex
    This should seldom happen.  It means that an expression or set of
    statements was too complex for ALICE to handle in the memory space it
    had.  You can usually correct the problem in expressions by breaking
    the expression up over several statements.  If a set of statements is
    too complex, you may be able to simplify things by putting some of the
    statements into a subprogram.
