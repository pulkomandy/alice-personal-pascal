Can't find the label NUMBER
(And related messages)
    You attempted a GOTO but ALICE could not find the label you wanted to
    go to.  Note that ALICE's search for the desired label follows
    different rules than some other versions of Pascal.  For example, ALICE
    will not let you jump into the middle of loops or IF statements;
    therefore, ALICE will not search for the the label you want inside such
    blocks.  In general, ALICE will let you jump OUT of things but will not
    let you jump INTO them.
