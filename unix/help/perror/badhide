You must select at least a whole line for hiding
    This happens when you have only highlighted part of a line and then
    issue the HIDE command.  If you issued the HIDE command by accident,
    don't worry about it.  If you really did want to hide that part of the
    line, you should reconsider.  HIDE is only intended to save space when
    displaying your program, and hiding part of a line will not save any
    space at all.  If you want to save space, hide the whole line.
