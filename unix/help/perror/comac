Command macros must be completed with '\n'
    If you define a macro with a '\c' (COMMAND) code in it, the macro
    must be completed with a '\n' (ENTER) code.  Due to the fact that
    ALICE doesn't echo on the command line when reading from a macro,
    you can't make a macro that leaves the cursor in the middle of
    command line input.
