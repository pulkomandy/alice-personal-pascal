Can't edit code fragments (yet)
    You have used COPY or MOVE to put part of a program into a workspace,
    then tried to edit that part of a program.  Right now, ALICE will only
    let you edit entire programs, not program fragments.  You will have to
    GET the fragment into a workspace that contains at least a PROGRAM
    template.  Once you have done this, you can edit the fragment.
         Note that later versions of ALICE will let you edit partial
    programs.
