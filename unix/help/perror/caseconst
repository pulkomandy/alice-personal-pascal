Constant isn't the same type as case value
    One of the constants in your case labels doesn't have the same type as
    the expression that is given in the CASE statement.  For example, if
    "i" is an integer variable

          case i of
            'a' : ...

    gives this sort of error because 'a' isn't the same type as "i".
    Either change the expression on the CASE statement line or change the
    case label value.
