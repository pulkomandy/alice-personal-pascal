StrConcat makes string too long to fit.
    When you use the StrConcat procedure to put one string on the end of
    another, the string that is being lengthened must be long enough to
    hold both strings.  In your case, you didn't declare this string to be
    long enough.  You should increase the length of the string.  You might
    also check to make sure that you have the order of the strings right.
    In

          StrConcat(str1,str2);

    "str2" is added to the end of "str1", so "str1" has to be long enough
    to hold both strings.
