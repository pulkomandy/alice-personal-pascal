Start/Finish not of appropriate type
(And variations of this message)
    In a FOR statement, the Start or Finish value wasn't the same type as
    the control variable.  These two must have the same type.  Either
    change the control variable (use a different variable or change the
    declaration of the variable you have), or change the Start or Finish
    value.
