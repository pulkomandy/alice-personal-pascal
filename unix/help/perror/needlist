Selected item must be an element in a list
(And variations of this message)
    You have selected (highlighted) a part of your program that was not a
    list or an element of a list, and you have tried to execute an ALICE
    command.  However, the command you tried to execute will only work on
    lists.  Make sure the command you issued really was the command you
    wanted.  Also make sure that you wanted to issue that command on the
    region the you highlighted; perhaps you really wanted to select a
    different region.
         After the error message is issued, the code you selected will stay
    selected (highlighted).  Either issue a command that doesn't need to
    work on a list, or UNSELECT the list by pushing F10 again.
