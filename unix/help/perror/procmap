You can't turn this into a procedure call
    If you have an instruction of the form

          undec := Value;

    where "undec" is an undeclared simple variable (no subscripts, no
    record field names) and Value is the usual empty placeholder, ALICE
    will let you change the instruction into a procedure call of the form

          undec(Value);

    All you have to do is type an opening parenthesis "(" after the
    variable name.  If you try to type the opening parenthesis and the
    assignment isn't in this form, you'll get the error message you just
    received.  Perhaps the name on the left was declared as a variable; or
    the thing on the right was not an empty placeholder.
