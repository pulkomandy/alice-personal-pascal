Put/Write - Not at end of file
    You tried a "put", "write", or "writeln" operation, but the file was
    not in an "eof" condition.  This means that you were trying to write in
    the middle of the file instead of on the end.  In Pascal, this sort of
    write operation is illegal.  The usual cause of the error is that you
    did not set up the file with the "rewrite" or "append" procedures;
    instead you may have used "reset".
