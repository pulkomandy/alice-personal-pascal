Can't enter immediate mode at this point
    This only happens when you have started up ALICE by choosing the
    "Experiment in Immediate Mode" selection from the Starting Menu.  Later
    on, you issued a command to enter Immediate Mode.  This message points
    out that you were already in Immediate Mode.
