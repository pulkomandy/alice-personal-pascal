You cannot output complex types with write
    You tried to write an unusual type of argument.  ALICE cannot write out
    things with "file" types, "set" types, or "array" types (although it
    can write out array elements, of course).  There are several other
    types of data that ALICE is not equipped to write, including most
    enumerated types and pointers.  In most cases, you will have to create
    your own writing subprogram for this kind of data.
