This set element doesn't match the first one
    Inside a set constant, the type of a particular element is not the same
    as the type of the first element in the set.  For example, you might
    have something like

          ['1',2,'3']

    The middle element of the set is an integer, while the other ones are
    characters (enclosed in single quotes).  When ALICE first sees a set,
    it assumes that every element should have the same type as the first
    element.  When one doesn't match, you get this error.  Either the first
    element is the wrong type or the element in the middle is wrong.
