Can't copy onto the current workspace
    You used the COPY or MOVE command and specified the name of the current
    workspace as the place where the source code should be sent.  This sort
    of operation would destroy everything in the workspace, and therefore
    is not allowed.  Issue the COPY or MOVE command again and specify the
    name of a different workspace.
