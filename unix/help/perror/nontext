Readln - text file required
    You tried to use the "readln" procedure to read things from a file that
    did not have the type "text".  You can only use "readln" on the
    predefined file variable "input" and on variables that are explicitly
    declared with the type "text".  If you want to read a different sort of
    file, use "read" or "get".
