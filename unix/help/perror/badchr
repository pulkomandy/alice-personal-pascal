chr: can't convert NUMBER to character
    You attempted to use the "chr" function on an integer, but there was no
    character corresponding to that integer.  The integer that you pass to
    "chr" must be in the range 0..255.  Single-stepping through your
    program may help you discover what is going wrong.
