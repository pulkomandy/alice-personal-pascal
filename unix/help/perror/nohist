This operation is too involved to UNDO
    ALICE keeps a region of memory to remember your editing operations so
    that it may UNDO them.  The action you have just requested (probably
    deleting, raising, enclosing or hiding a long list of statements)
    would require more storage remembering UNDO information than you
    have available.  You can either proceed with the action and be unable
    to UNDO it, or do the action in smaller chunks.
