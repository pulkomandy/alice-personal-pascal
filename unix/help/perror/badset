Sets in ALICE Must Contain Ordinal Values in Range 0..255
    The base type of a set may contain a maximum of 256 elements.
    Moreover, the maximum ordinal value (from the "ord" function) in the
    base type must be less than or equal to 255.  None of the elements of
    the base type can be negative.  This means that "set of char" is all
    right, but "set of integer" is invalid, as well as sets of subranges
    like 0..1000 (upper limit is too high) and -2..2 (can't have nega-
    tives).
