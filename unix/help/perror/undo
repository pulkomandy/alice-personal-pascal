Nothing to undo
    You tried to issue the UNDO command, but you haven't done anything yet
    so ALICE can't undo anything.  If you issued the command by accident,
    don't worry -- nothing happened.  You may also get this message if you
    tried to do too many UNDO commands in a row.  ALICE can only UNDO a
    limited number of commands; if you try to UNDO more than that number,
    you'll get this error message.
