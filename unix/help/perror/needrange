You must select a range first - see SELECT command
    The command that you tried to issue won't work until you select a sec-
    tion of your code.  If you issued the command by accident, don't worry
    -- nothing happened.  If you really want to issue the command, you must
    select a part of your program by pressing the F10 key, then moving the
    cursor to "sweep" out part of your program.
