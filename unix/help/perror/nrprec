Precisions may only be applied to real numbers
    In a "write" or "writeln" instruction, you had an argument of the form
    "a:m:n", where "m" and "n" were integers.  For this form to be valid,
    "a" must be a real number.  In your program, however, "a" was not a
    real number.  Either change the argument that you are trying to write
    out so that it IS a real number, or delete the ":n".
