Substr: Substring too long to fit in destination
    In a call to the SubStr procedure, you obtained a substring that was
    too long to fit in the string variable where you wanted to put the
    substring.  This would happen in

          SubStr(str1,LENGTH,subscript,str2);

    if the substring length LENGTH was greater than the length of "str2".
    Either change the declaration of "str2" so it has room for more
    characters, or decrease the LENGTH that you specify.
