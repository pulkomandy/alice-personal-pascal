Operand must be integer or real
    You tried to perform a numeric operation on something that wasn't a
    number.  Check the type on the values that appear in the operation.
    Either change these values or change the operation.  The "ord" function
    may be useful -- it converts an enumerated type or a character into an
    integer.
