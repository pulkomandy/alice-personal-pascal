Expression syntax error
    You have entered an expression that had an incorrect form.  Most of the
    time, it should be easy to understand what went wrong -- the expression
    should LOOK wrong.  To correct the error, you can SELECT the
    highlighted expression and then choose the EDIT command from the Change
    Menu to edit the expression.  You can also SELECT the expression,
    delete it, and retype it again, or you can just UNDO the expression.
         If you do not understand why the expression is incorrect, check
    your user's manual or textbook to see how such expressions should be
    written.
