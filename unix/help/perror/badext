Bad file extension
    You tried to save a program into a file with an inappropriate exten-
    sion.  For example, you tried to save an ALICE-format program into a
    file with the ".pas" extension or you tried to save a text program into
    a file with the ".ap" extension.  ALICE will not permit this.
