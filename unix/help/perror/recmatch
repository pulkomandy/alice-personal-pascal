Field name NAME no longer matches the record
    This error occurs while you are editing your program.  You originally
    had an expression of the form

          record . field

    You deleted the name of the original record and put in the name of a
    different record.  The problem is that ALICE will not let you change
    the record name unless you change the field name as well.  You must
    delete the "field" name using the CLIP command and replace it with the
    name of a field that is actually in the record.  Note that you will get
    this message even if the two different records have fields with the
    same name.
