This parameter must be a procedure
    In a call to a subprogram, the indicated argument should be a
    procedure.  The argument you gave was NOT a procedure.
         When a subprogram expects a procedure argument, you only specify
    the name of the procedure when you call the subprogram.  For example,
    if "procarg" is a subprogram that takes a procedure as an argument, you
    might say

          procard(page);

    to pass the "page" procedure as the appropriate argument.  You do NOT
    specify any arguments for the procedure being passed.
