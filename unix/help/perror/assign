Types on := don't match
    You attempted to assign a value to a variable, but the value had a
    different type than the variable, as in

          intvar := 3.4;  {Can't assign real to integer}
          intvar := '1';  {'1' is char even though it looks integer}
          charvar := 'hello';  {'hello' is packed array of char}

    This is a fairly common error.  Check the type that has been declared
    for the variable.  This must match the type of the value on the right
    of the assignment.  Either change the value or change the variable
    declaration.
