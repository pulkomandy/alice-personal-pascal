Undefined case VALUE
    While executing a CASE statement, ALICE came up with a value that
    didn't match any of the listed case labels.  In addition, there wasn't
    an ELSE clause to handle such values.  To correct this problem, add an
    ELSE clause or a case to handle the value that ALICE found.  It might
    also be that some other error in the program resulted in an incorrect
    value by the time ALICE got to the CASE statement.  If the CASE state-
    ment should not have received this value, figure out where the value
    came from and correct the problem.  Single-stepping may help you locate
    where the trouble arose.
