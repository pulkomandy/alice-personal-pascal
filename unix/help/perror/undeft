Undefined type name
    You used a named type that ALICE didn't recognize.  The most common
    cause of this error is a simple spelling mistake -- you were typing a
    name that you already declared and just spelled it wrong.  To correct
    this, press CTRL-U to UNDO your error, then retype the name correctly.
         Another common cause is forgetting to put in the declaration for
    the name.  To add this declaration, just type "type".  ALICE will jump
    up to the appropriate TYPE declaration section and let you enter the
    new declaration.
