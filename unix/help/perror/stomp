Previous contents of workspace NAME deleted
    This is just a warning, not an actual error.  When you use the COPY or
    MOVE command to put something into a workspace that already contains
    material, the material that was previously in that workspace is all
    deleted.  If you see this message and realize that you didn't want to
    get rid of that material, just type CTRL-U to UNDO the COPY or MOVE.
