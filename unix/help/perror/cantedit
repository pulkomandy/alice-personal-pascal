Can't change a SOMETHING textually
    You tried to use the EDIT command on something that the command won't
    work on.  EDIT only works on expressions, strings, declaration names,
    and comments.  If you want to edit other kinds of code (like the start
    of a WHILE statement), you have to use a different sort of command.
