dot (.) requires a record variable on the left
    The "." is used for two things in Pascal -- it is used as a decimal
    point in real numbers and it is used when you want to get at a field in
    a record.  If you got this error message when you were trying to use
    the dot as a decimal point, your mistake is that the thing before the
    decimal point isn't a number.  Remember that real numbers need at least
    one digit before and after the decimal point.  If you got this error
    message when you were trying to get at a field in a record, the name
    before the dot was not the name of a record type variable.  Check the
    name that you typed, and check the declaration for that name; either
    the name or the declaration has to be changed.  (Note that ALICE erases
    what comes after the dot even if it was the thing before the dot that
    was in error.  ALICE apologizes but it can't be helped.)
