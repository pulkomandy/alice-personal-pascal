READ/GET - tried to get past end of file
    In a "read", "readln" or "get" operation, you attempted to read beyond
    the end of a file.  Use the "eof" function to determine when you have
    reached the end of a file, and do not try to read any further.  Also,
    you might check that the file you are trying to read actually contains
    valid data.
         Another common cause for this error is trying to read a file that
    was actually set up for writing with "rewrite" or "append".  To read
    from a file, you should set it up with "reset".
