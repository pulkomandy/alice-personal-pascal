Not enough memory to load program
    You tried to load a program, but ALICE didn't have enough memory space
    to do this.  Instead, ALICE will give you an empty program template.
         There are two ways this error could happen.  You could be trying
    to edit several programs in several workspaces and just not have room
    for another program; or you could be trying to load a very large
    program.  In the first case, just get rid of workspaces you don't need
    or quit ALICE and start again.  In the second case, it is best to quit,
    restart ALICE and try the load again.  This will help some, but you will
    immediately have to start shrinking the program somehow or you will
    soon run out of memory again.
