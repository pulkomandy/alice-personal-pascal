Breakpoints should only be put on statements
    You attempted to put a breakpoint on something that was not a complete
    statement.  The most common cause of this error is highlighting only
    PART of a statement before setting the breakpoint.  For example, it is
    not enough to highlight the word "writeln" in a "writeln" instruction.
    You must make sure that the entire line is highlighted.
