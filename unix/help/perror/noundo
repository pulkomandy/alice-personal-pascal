Memory recovered -- cannot undo past this point
    This is a warning, not an error message.  You have performed an opera-
    tion that has cleaned up a lot of things inside ALICE to make more room
    in memory.  One of the things that was cleaned away was ALICE's record
    of your recent actions.  Since this has been cleaned away, you will not
    be able to UNDO anything that happened before memory was cleaned.
