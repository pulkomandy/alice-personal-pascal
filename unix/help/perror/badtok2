The input is not valid here. It would be if you did a delete.
    The thing you tried to type in couldn't legally be typed in the current
    location of the cursor because there is something there already.  This
    often happens when you have an error marked on the screen and you try
    to correct simply by typing in something new.  You have to delete the
    error first with CLIP (CTRL-DEL) or DELETE (SHIFT-DEL) and then you can
    type in the correct material.
         Note that the cursor may be on a very large block of code, e.g. a
    WHILE loop that contains many statements.  In this case, you won't want
    to delete the entire block.  You may want to make a Special Change to
    change the WHILE into another type of statement.
