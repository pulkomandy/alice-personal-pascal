StrInsert: String too long
    In a call to the StrInsert procedure, you attempted to insert a string
    that was too big to fit in the space provided.  For example, in

          StrInsert(str1,str2,N);

    the "packed array of char" called "str1" is not big enough to hold its
    own elements plus the elements of "str2".  Either change the declara-
    tion of "str1" to make it bigger, or make "str2" smaller somehow.
