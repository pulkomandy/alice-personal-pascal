Bad Save Format
(And variations of this message)
    You tried to load a program from a file, but the file didn't contain a
    program in the ALICE Pascal format.  Check the file to make sure it
    contains an ALICE Pascal program.  If it does, the program was probably
    saved using an old version of ALICE, and your current version of ALICE
    uses a different file format.  To convert the program to the new
    format, quit ALICE and type

            apmap4 file

    where "file" is the name of the old format file.  The APMAP4 program
    will convert this file into the current format, and you may then LOAD
    it into ALICE normally.
