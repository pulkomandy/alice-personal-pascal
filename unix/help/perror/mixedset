Non-set value combined with set
    You have tried to execute an operation where one operand was a set and
    the other was not.  One possible cause of this is confusing an array
    subscript with a set.  Both subscripts and set elements are enclosed in
    square brackets, so if you made a small error when typing an array
    subscript operation, ALICE may become confused.
