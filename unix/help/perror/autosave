No file associated with workspace
    You issued an AUTOSAVE command to save your program every few opera-
    tions.  However, there is no file name associated with your workspace,
    so ALICE has nowhere to save the program.  Either turn off AUTOSAVE or
    set a file name using the FILENAME command.
