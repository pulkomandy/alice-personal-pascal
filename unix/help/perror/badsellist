This command can't be applied to a list
    You have selected (highlighted) a list of things (for example, instruc-
    tions or declarations) and then have tried to execute an ALICE command.
    However, the command you tried to execute will not work on a list.
    Make sure the command you issued really was the command you wanted.
    Also make sure that you wanted to issue that command on a list of
    things; perhaps you selected the list by accident.
         After the error message is issued, the list will stay selected
    (highlighted).  Either issue a command that CAN work on a list of
    things, or UNSELECT the list by pushing F10 again.
