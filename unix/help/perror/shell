Error executing "command" - cause : <<error>>

There are many reasons why a SHELL command might fail.  The most
likely is that you typed the name of a command QNX doesn't know about.
This may have been a spelling error - check the name and try again.

It's also possible you don't have enough memory to run this QNX command
or the shell itself.  On a 384K ICON, you will not have enough memory.

The command you executed might have failed and reported this failure.
This will also cause this error message.
