Operands of DIV/MOD must be integers
    You had an expression that had one of the forms

          A div B
          A mod B

    but A or B (or both) were not integers.  You can only use "div" and
    "mod" on integers.  A common cause of this problem is using "div" or
    "mod" with expressions that give non-integer results.  For example,
    (8/4 mod 2) will result in this error.  8/4 is a real number because it
    uses real division.
