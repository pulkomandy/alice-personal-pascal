There is no declaration for this item
    You tried to use the DECL command to go to the declaration of some
    name, but ALICE could not do this.  The most common cause of this error
    is that the cursor was not pointing to an actual name.  For example, it
    might have been resting on a constant instead of a variable name.  It
    is also possible that the name you were pointing to is a built-in name
    (like the type name "integer").  You cannot obtain the declaration for
    a built-in name.
