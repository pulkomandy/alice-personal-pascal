This parameter must be a variable
    The argument that you passed to a subprogram must be a variable because
    the subprogram has declared this to be a VAR argument.  Generally, this
    means that the subprogram intends to assign a value to this variable.
    As an example,

          readln(4);

    is incorrect.  "Readln" reads a value and tries to store that value in
    its argument.  For this to be possible, the argument must be a
    variable.  You must change the incorrect argument into something that
    is a variable.
