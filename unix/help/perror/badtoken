The input is not valid. Try the HELP key
(And variations of this message.)
    The thing you tried to type in couldn't legally be typed in the current
    location of the cursor.  One of the most common causes of this error is
    simply typing random letters in a place where ALICE doesn't expect
    this.  It can also occur when you attempt to fill a number into a
    placeholder that shouldn't contain a number.  Move the cursor or press
    SHIFT-times to give you an idea of what IS legal.
