Undefined name
(And various other messages)
    You used a name that ALICE didn't recognize.  This could be the name of
    a type, a variable, a named constant, or a subprogram.
         The most common cause of this error is a simple spelling mistake
    -- you were typing a name that you already declared and just spelled it
    wrong.  To correct this, press CTRL-U to UNDO your error, then retype
    the name correctly.
         Another common cause is forgetting to put in the declaration for
    the name.  To add this declaration, just type "var", "type", "const",
    "procedure", or "function" (depending on what the name stands for).
    ALICE will jump up to the appropriate declaration section and you can
    then add the necessary declaration.
