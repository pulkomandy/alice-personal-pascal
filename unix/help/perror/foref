Symbol used before it is defined
    It is illegal to use a symbol (in declarations) before it is defined.
    For example, the following is invalid:

          type
              col = red..green;
              colours = (red,blue,orange,green,purple);

    The definition of "col" is called a forward reference because the
    explanation of "red" and "green" comes later in the program.
         The only kind of legal forward reference involves pointers.  You
    can talk about a pointer to a particular type before you have declared
    the type as in

          type
              MONEYP = ^MONEY;
              MONEY = real;
