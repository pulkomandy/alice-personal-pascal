Out of memory
    This is a serious problem that likely means ALICE itself has made an
    error.  Save your program immediately so you don't lose anything.
    After this, you can load the program again to see if the problem has
    gone away.  If it hasn't, you may have to make your program smaller
    somehow.  One way to shrink things is to issue the RECOVER command.
    You can also use the "l=" and "s=" command line options when invoking
    ALICE.  These are described in the ALICE Reference Manual.
