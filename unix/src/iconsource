Structure of the ALICE source code for the ICON -- version 1.5

The main ALICE source directory can be placed just about anywhere.
Most of the ALICE source files themselves are packed into archives
with the "par" program, and must be unpacked into this directory.

The "unpar" program can be found in "/user_cmds/unpar" on the ALICE
distribution disk and on ALICE source disk #2.  If it is not already in
your own "/user/cmds" directory, place it there.

Create a directory on your fileserver called "/src/curses".  The
".o" files from the curses library (found in /src/curses on the
ALICE source disk #2) must go there.  Copy the ".o" files from disk #2's
"/src/curses" directory there.  The curses library is the ICON version of
our portable screen access library.  Source is provided if you need to
recreate it, but it is generally treated by us as a library.

	backup 2:/src/curses 1:/src/curses p=*.o


Create a directory for the ALICE source.  You can use "/src/alice" or
"/alice/src" (or "/alice/at" if you want to use the same structure that
we use).

You will find "par" files in the /src/par directories on both disks.
You will want to unpack them by saying something like

	cd /alice/src  (alice source directory)
	unpar <2:/src/par/cpar1
	unpar <2:/src/par/cpar2
	unpar <2:/src/par/hf.par
	   and on SOURCE DISK #2
	unpar <2:/src/par/cpar3

A few other files from disk #2 need to be moved over.  These are the
files in /src that are not packed in archives.  Included are the source
to the template generator, the Makefile for ALICE and the "linkit"
shell script that links ALICE.  Copy these over.
Also get "speech1.o" from the Cemcorp toolkit speech library.

You will need to place a few files in the "/lib" directory of your ICON
for use by the c preprocessor.  These can be found in /lib of disk #2.
Use the backup or cp commands to move these files over.  You may have to
modify permissions on the "/lib" directory to move files there.

	backup 2:/lib 1:/lib +a


If you wish to compile the APIN program, copy over the /src/apin directory
from disk #2
	mkdir /alice/src/apin
	backup 2:/src/apin /alice/src/apin +a

TO TEST ALICE
	You will need all of Alice's extra files to test it once compiled.
	You should thus have alice installed on your machine, although
	you can remove "/user_cmds/alice.bin" before compiling.

	Notably alice needs
		/fonts/alice
		/config/pas.tpl
		/config/apbuiltin
		/config/ap.init
	in order to run.

TO COMPILE ALICE
	Simply say "make" in the source directory.  You need the QNX
	"make" program.  You should be using QNX 2.2 and the latest compiler
	from Quantum.

To compile the template generator
	"make template" in the source directory.

To compile APIN
	"make" in the APIN directory.


The development of ALICE has required that we make use of many advanced
features not normally available to ICON users.  We get these advanced
features directly from Quantum.  Only recently have these tools started
to show up in Cemcorp releases.  There may still be some tools around
that haven't shown up.  Call us at 519-884-7473 if you are missing some
of these.
