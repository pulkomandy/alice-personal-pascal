ALICE Compiler

The Alice compiler, do be delivered in Beta Test form by LGS by Sept 1,
1986, shall have the following features:

 o The ability to compile Alice Pascal programs (including extended Turbo
   features) in memory.  This will be done on a procedure by procedure
   basis with dynamic linking, so that changed routines may be compiled
   individually for the fastest possible compile time.

 o The ability to, upon request, compile these routines into intel format
   object modules suitable for linking with the DOS linker.  This includes
   the ability to call library routines prepared either with Alice Pascal,
   assembler, or the Lattice and Microsoft C compilers

 o A limited ability to combine interpretation of in-memory routines with
   execution of compiled in-memory routines.

 o Runtime libraries, both in "in memory" format and .OBJ format, to support
   all ALICE and Turbo builtin procedures and functions

 o Floating point support that detects the presence of an 8087 in a machine
   and uses it if possible, emulating otherwise.  Turbo is currently
   seriously lacking in this area

 o The ability to use Turbo-Pascal style libraries during in-memory
   compilation, providing these libraries operate according to the definitions
   in the Turbo manual and do not perform special interactions with Turbo
   Pascal or use Turbo format floating point numbers.

 o Execution speed of compiled programs will be at a similar level to
   Turbo Pascal

 o There is no guarantee that .OBJ libraries prepared for C compilers will
   be loadable into the in-memory compilation environment.  This will
   be examined for later work.

 o It is highly doubtful that the system will run on a 256K IBM-PC

 o The compiler will support ISO level 0 Pascal to the extent that Alice
   1.3 does

 o The compiler will support "large model pointers" so that programs may
   access all the memory of their machine

 o The compiler will support "long calls" so that programs may contain
   more than 64K of code - currently a major limitation of Turbo Pascal
